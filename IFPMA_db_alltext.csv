"4","AbbVie generic LPV/r manufacturing agreement","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; address future demands for hiv treatment lopinavir/ritonavir (lpv/r) in south africa and across africa, by increasing the number of manufacturers and suppliers.; ; ; ; ; description of partnership activities and how they addressNEEDS; africa accounts for approximately 90% of the total usage of lpv/r in donor-funded developing countries. the medicines patent pool (mpp) and abbvie signed a new licensing agreement to help ensure sustainability of long-term supply of lpv/r, the most widely used second-line hiv treatment in south africa and across africa. upon obtaining a sublicense from mpp, the agreement allows generic arv manufacturers to manufacture and sell generic versions of lpv/r throughout africa, as well as combinations of ritonavir with other arvs, such as atazanavir and darunavir, as alternative second-line treatments.; the mpp will work to swiftly grant licences to generic manufacturers with stringent regulatory approval.  those that have already received regulatory approval for these medicines in south africa will be able to distribute in the country. the south african government will consider applications from other manufacturers that wish to seek approval under its fast track process. by doing so, it will aim to secure supply of the product as treatment needs increase, as well as to support the ministry of health in providing care for communities living with hiv.; the agreement  also allow global manufacturers to supply lpv/r and other ritonavir-based combinations to the whole african continent. while many african countries are currently able to purchase generic versions of these medicines from india, this license will enable manufacturers in other countries where there are patents, such as china and south africa, to manufacture lpv/r and other ritonavir-based treatments, thus broadening the supplier base for the entire african continent.; the licence is royalty free and, as is the case for all mpp licences, is non-exclusive and published on the mpp website.  the agreement represents the second licence established between mpp and abbvie. the first agreement was for paediatric formulations of lpv/r signed in december 2014. more information are available here. ;

the strong commitment of the aai companies to improving access to treatment manifested itself in many innovative ways. all aai companies had individual programs through which they provided their own antiretroviral medicines at more affordable prices in developing countries. some aai companies expanded manufacturing capacity to meet product demand in the developing world. individual aai companies also took other actions to increase the overall availability of arvs, including the granting of voluntary licenses or non-assert declarations, contract manufacturing with generic manufacturers and technology transfer agreements. these efforts are delivered results:in september 2008, 773,803 patients in developing countries were estimated to be taking one or more medicines supplied at preferential prices by an aai company. in addition, the number of patients in developing countries treated with generic arvs - including those through cooperative efforts with aai companies - increased significantly.; aai partners recognize that expanded access to medications requires a collaborative approach with governments, ngos, multilateral organizations, and other public and private bodies. many aai companies involved in initiatives to strengthen healthcare systems streamline product registrations and conduct clinical studies in developing countries. aai companies also invested significantly in research and development of new medications - including pediatric formulations - and diagnostics, to help combat the global hiv/aids pandemic.;

thanks to the support of partner world bank group, the initiative will also identify solutions to address financing, regulatory and service delivery barriers at country level.; in addition, access accelerated will set up partnerships with organizations specializing in major ncds, starting with cancer. cancer is a prime example of an ncd for which disease awareness, screening and early diagnosis are key to treatment. as part of this effort, a coalition of companies will be the founding partners of the uicc’s c/can 2025. in 2017, c/can 2025 will engage cities around the world to improve cancer treatment and care, working specifically with cities in lmics which require international support to deliver effective, sustainable cancer care. ;","almirall;

"14","Aeras","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; many people think of tuberculosis as a disease of the past, but the reality is that tb is an urgent public health crisis. each year, more than 8.5 million people become sick with tb and 1.3 million people die of the disease. in fact, tb is the leading cause of death among people living with hiv, causing one out of every four deaths. it is also the third leading cause of death for women, affecting people during their most productive years (ages 15-44).; while control programs are making progress in reducing deaths from tb, global tb incidence relative to population growth has remained consistently high. there are almost 1 million more cases of tb in the world today (8.6 million) than in 1990 (7.8 million). and because of growing drug resistance, tb is becoming much more difficult and expensive to treat.; research and development for new vaccines would have the biggest impact on the epidemic, and remains the cornerstone to reaching global elimination within the coming decades.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:; the most effective way to stop the global tb epidemic is to prevent the spread of m. tuberculosis, but that is becoming increasingly difficult with the rise of multidrug-resistant tb (mdr-tb) and extensively drug-resistant tb (xdr-tb), the latter of which is resistant to most first- and second-line drugs. ; aeras was founded in 1997 to develop new concepts and tools to control the global tb epidemic. it is the goal of aeras to develop, test, characterize, license, manufacture and distribute at least one new tb vaccine within 10 years.; gsk has long been committed to developing an effective tool against tb disease. for about 10 years, the company has been working with organizations such as aeras in the development of a tb vaccine to ensure access to an effective tb vaccine to the populations who need it most. gsk’s current m72/as01e candidate prophylactic vaccine has been tested in early stage phase i/ii studies in europe and tb endemic countries.  in october 2012, gsk and aeras entered into a new agreement with the goal of assessing the potential efficacy of the m72/as01e candidate vaccine against tb disease and to investigate biomarkers of risk for tb disease and possible correlates of protection, which would benefit the tb vaccine field in general. the trial is targeted to start in summer 2014 and will enrol more than 3500 participants across several trial sites in south africa, zambia and kenya. information on the clinical trials is available online.; first-in-human studies are small studies in healthy adults - usually 20-80 subjects - to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate.; phase i clinical trials are small safety studies in different target populations. these may include a preliminary assessment of dose-range and/or age de-escalation.; phase iia clinical trials are larger studies - usually 100-300 subjects - that explore dose-range in target populations with the goal of identifying the optimum dose; the dosing schedule; and/or the route of administration based on safety, immunogenicity and/or biological endpoints. these are focused studies designed to provide evidence of biological activity in the target population.; phase iib clinical trials are larger, well-controlled studies that evaluate safety and proof-of-concept/efficacy. these trials usually include more than 1,000 subjects and are designed to demonstrate evidence of disease prevention or treatment in the target population.; phase iii clinical trials are pivotal registration studies to support licensure. they are designed to demonstrate statistically significant evidence of disease prevention or treatment and long-term safety in target populations as required by national regulatory authorities. these studies are conducted with the final manufactured product.; lessons learned:; south africa is particularly poised as a key driver of tb vaccine innovation, since it has the highest incidence of the disease and is well-equipped with world-renowned researchers and infrastructure to conduct tb studies. our in-country partners provide primary and follow-up care to communities involved in clinical trials. they educate the local communities and raise awareness about tb and vaccine trials.; recently, the successful completion of the first large, phase iib trial in south africa of nearly 3,000 infants showed that it is possible to conduct a trial of that scope and magnitude, even though the vaccine did not prove to be more efficacious than the widely used infant vaccine bcg.;

summary of impact and forward looking information; serving as a critical translational bridge from the bench to the field aeras has sponsored and conducted over 25 clinical vaccine trials enrolling thousands of subjects, and is a key partner in six active clinical development programs.;","many people think of tuberculosis as a disease of the past, but the reality is that tb is an urgent public health crisis. each year, more than 8.5 million people become sick with tb and 1.3 million people die of the disease. in fact, tb is the leading cause of death among people living with hiv, causing one out of every four deaths. it is also the third leading cause of death for women, affecting people during their most productive years (ages 15-44).; while control programs are making progress in reducing deaths from tb, global tb incidence relative to population growth has remained consistently high. there are almost 1 million more cases of tb in the world today (8.6 million) than in 1990 (7.8 million). and because of growing drug resistance, tb is becoming much more difficult and expensive to treat.; research and development for new vaccines would have the biggest impact on the epidemic, and remains the cornerstone to reaching global elimination within the coming decades.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:; the most effective way to stop the global tb epidemic is to prevent the spread of m. tuberculosis, but that is becoming increasingly difficult with the rise of multidrug-resistant tb (mdr-tb) and extensively drug-resistant tb (xdr-tb), the latter of which is resistant to most first- and second-line drugs. ; aeras was founded in 1997 to develop new concepts and tools to control the global tb epidemic. it is the goal of aeras to develop, test, characterize, license, manufacture and distribute at least one new tb vaccine within 10 years.; gsk has long been committed to developing an effective tool against tb disease. for about 10 years, the company has been working with organizations such as aeras in the development of a tb vaccine to ensure access to an effective tb vaccine to the populations who need it most. gsk’s current m72/as01e candidate prophylactic vaccine has been tested in early stage phase i/ii studies in europe and tb endemic countries.  in october 2012, gsk and aeras entered into a new agreement with the goal of assessing the potential efficacy of the m72/as01e candidate vaccine against tb disease and to investigate biomarkers of risk for tb disease and possible correlates of protection, which would benefit the tb vaccine field in general. the trial is targeted to start in summer 2014 and will enrol more than 3500 participants across several trial sites in south africa, zambia and kenya. information on the clinical trials is available online.;

the lilly foundation's funding helped equip the center's new oncology outpatient center and allowed for the hiring of additional doctors, physicians' assistants and other staff to screen and treat more people. additionally, the funding supports the creation of a research and training institute focused on cancer prevention, screening, treatment and supportive care. the institute also helps building much-needed capacity among local healthcare providers.the ampath oncology institute provides access to quality cancer care to the 18 million people residing in western kenya.;

; OBJECTIVES; the primary goal of our program is to reduce the mortality and morbidity of common cancers, hiv, tb and other ncds in people aging and growing with hiv by supporting clinics to scale up awareness, screening and treatment services in an integrated chronic care model in the uthukela district, kwazulu-natal, south africa.   ; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; sub-saharan africa is experiencing a multiple disease burden. non-communicable diseases (ncds) are emerging, and their risk factors are becoming more common as lifestyles change due to rapid urbanization, especially in poor communities. environmental and lifestyle effects of urbanization, targeted marketing for alcohol and cigarettes, gender and   social norms also add to a rise in ncds, especially in women. simultaneously, epidemics of infectious diseases such as hiv/aids and tuberculosis persist in the region. according to unaids, one third of persons screened at hiv testing sites are obese and have hypertension.; given the declining hiv/aids mortality rates and longer life expectancy due to the up-scaling of art with its concomitant metabolic complications, evidence has shown that hiv-infected adults on art have a much higher risk of developing other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,  chronic obstructive lung diseases as well as kidney disease. other hiv/aids comorbid diseases on the increase include common female cancers such as cervical and breast cancer as well mental illness and substance abuse. two thirds of premature deaths (between 30-70yrs) are linked to exposure to ncd risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, poor diet and physical inactivity and poor healthcare services. since the advent of art, hiv-infected women are no longer dying from opportunistic infections, but are living long enough to develop and die from cervical and breast cancer. in south africa, breast cancer and cervical cancer remain the most common cancers amongst women. according to the hpv information centre, the estimated number of new cases of cervical cancer in south africa is over 7,000 per annum with an age-standardized rate of 31.7/100 000 . the estimated number of deaths among women in south africa from cervical cancer is approximately over 4200 each year. this higher prevalence of cervical cancer and pre-cancer disease is also due to co-infection of patients with hiv and the human papillomavirus (hpv), which is the causal agent for cervical cancer. 60-80% of hiv-infected women in sub-saharan africa are infected with the hpv virus, placing them at substantially increased risk for cervical cancer. the risk of cervical cancer in hiv-infected women has been found to be three times higher than in hiv-uninfected women globally. this calls for a scale up of efforts to reduce the risk of invasive cervical cancer through screening programs targeting hiv positive women with the ultimate goal of expanding the services to hiv uninfected women. ; on the other hand 50% of hiv transmission takes place among those aged 15–24 and 5 000–6000 young people become infected every day because of poor access to health services and commodities, early sexual debut, sexual coercion and violence,  growing up without parents and abuse.. for those on art, adherence may further be compromised due to partial or non-disclosure by their parents or caregivers, usually a grandparent, as well as lack of psychosocial support.  awareness and education programs for adolescents and young adults on risk factors for stis, common cancers and the effects of smoking and alcohol use are not sub optimal in south africa.;

the projects have already had a significant on the management and prevention of ncds within the country scope. the smoking cessation sms support programme in costa rica has resulted in a 10% quit rate, which is two times the usual cessation figure. in addition, the mdiabetes programme in senegal has effectively increased awareness of the disease, helped train health workers through mtraining and also helped patients with disease management through remote consultations and support. ; the 8 projects currently in operation are generating significant results which could be replicated across other countries. the construction of toolkits will also inform other countries on how best to harness mobile technology for the prevention and control of ncds. ;","glaxosmithkline;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; since 2011, celgene has collaborated with the academic model providing access to healthcare (ampath) and its partners to deliver health services, conduct health research and develop leaders in healthcare. the support of celgene and other key donors has allowed a dramatic expansion of services through the ampath-oncology institute (aoi). this effort is focused on the development of a sustainable and comprehensive academic clinical care cancer program serving the 20 million citizens of western kenya and neighboring areas.  nearly 20,000 patient visits to ampath-oncology occur each year with approximately 15,000-20,000 women also being screened for breast and cervical cancers. to date more than 100,000 women have been screened for these two cancers that have the highest morbidity and mortality. ; organizationally, the aoi has four clinical pillars:; celgene’s support of the ampath oncology institute has enabled the creation of a successful multiple myeloma program, the first and only in kenya. ; the ampath mm program conducts extensive patient and family education; it held 10 patient support group meetings over the course of 2015 and supported the care of 61 new patients with mm. the program has conducted multiple continuing medical education (cmes) on multiple myeloma per quarter and has expanded its reach to 12 outreach sites and other sites in western kenya. celgene has also supported the establishment of a robust oncology pharmacist-led mm pharmacovigilance program and funded it support for the development of electronic medical records for the mm program with decision support. ; in addition to the mm program, celgene is also providing robust assistance to ampath’s pharmacy infrastructure and novel patient care strategies - including expansion of the: anti-coagulation program, the learning to care program - from apathy to empathe program and the counterfeit medication detection program into tanzania. in addition, celgene provides support for education for patients with hematologic disorders, pharmaceutical supply chain enhancement, infrastructure support, and the development of a pharmacy residency training program.; summary of impact and forward looking information; celgene’s support of the ampath oncology institute has enabled the creation of a successful multiple myeloma program, the first and only in kenya.  achievements include: ; ampath-mm program is currently seeking irb approval for a 5-year retrospective data-driven study to demonstrate the feasibility of mm care with comparable outcomes in a resource poor country to more advanced settings.; additional acheivements include:; 1) establishment of the college of oncology of eastern, central and southern africa (co-ecsa) in 2016 to help regulate and improve cancer care in the region. the proposed purpose of the college will be to: ; 2) moi teaching and referral hospital is embarking on establishing itself as a clinical pharmacy center of excellence where pharmacists will be deployed to all the high volume wards in the hospital to provide clinical pharmacy services as opposed to occupying their traditional dispensing role.; 3) anticoagulation care has expanded to serve over 2,300 patients.; 4) increase in numbers of permanently hired testing counselors available for patient care. in just one month, this enhanced testing as a result of celgene sponsored programs resulted in a 60% increase in the numbers of hiv-infected patients identified on the wards.;

"54","Children Without Worms","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; many diseases disproportionately affect women and children in the developing world, and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (sth) is one of them.; although the world health organization (who) estimates that sth infections cause as many as 135,000 deaths a year, the greatest public health significance is the chronic and disabling effects of these infections. effects include abdominal pain and distension, intestinal obstruction, iron-deficiency anemia, increased susceptibility to other serious infections, stunted growth and impaired cognitive development in children. ultimately, these conditions may have socio-economic consequences such as poor school performance in children, which in turn leads to decreased labor productivity when these children become adults.; over 267 million preschool-age children and over 568 million school-age children are infected with intestinal worms. according to the who, in 2010, only about 30% are receiving treatment. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; children without worms (cww) has a mission of enhancing the health and development of children by reducing intestinal worm infections through its work in country support, partnerships and advocacy, knowledge management, and technical and scientific collaboration.; cww advocates for a comprehensive strategy to break the cycle of reinfection with soil-transmitted helminths, referred to as the four-component strategy—water, sanitation, hygiene education and deworming—the washed framework.; with increased drug donations, there needs to be a systematic means to allocate the medicines, assist countries in developing the capacity to administer the treatment programs, and subsequently monitor the progress and health impact. children without worms (cww) serves as the secretariat to the program to ensure that the objectives of the program are being met. project partners include the ministries of health and ministries of education of recipient countries. cww also works with these governmental agencies to identify in-country, non-governmental organizations (ngos) to institute hygiene education in regular curricula and to install and maintain water and sanitation facilities.; working with multiple countries comes with challenges unique to individual countries and are addressed on a case-by-case basis. cww is the secretariat to the sth advisory committee, which has representatives from academia, global health authorities (including the who), health economists, epidemiologists, country program managers and government ministries. key issues are addressed and discussed at this level, and plans of action are developed. in executing solutions, country ministries and program managers are integrally involved because of the need to ensure country ownership.; lessons learned; the medicines to treat intestinal worms made available from both j&j and gsk are only one part of the solution. inclusion of hygiene education and clean water and adequate sanitation are key to preventing transmission and re-infection of sth. if these issues are not addressed, treatment will need to be carried out in perpetuity. with the renewed commitments on ntds as they relate to achieving the mdgs, there is a need to develop collaborations with those involved in watsan and infrastructure development.; the funding for ntds, especially for the control of sth, is never guaranteed. it is critical to be vigilant in advocating for continued support of the program from year to year. it does not have the visibility of other major diseases like hiv/aids, tb and malaria. however, the morbidity due to high intensity of infection is no less debilitating; robbing chronic sufferers from a quality of life and subsequently, a productive livelihood. the dalys lost, a measure of disease burden, from chronic infections is significant and relegates communities and populations to a vicious cycle of poverty.; summary of impact and forward looking information; to date, johnson & johnson has donated more than 1 billion doses of mebendazole and plans to donate up to 200 million doses each year through 2020 as part of its commitment to london declaration on neglected tropical diseases (ntds).  together with a major annual donation of albendazole by gsk, this donation program has had a major impact on providing treatment to over 75% of the 870 million at risk children targeted by the who. ;

 ;","there is a lack of access to and reimbursement for cancer treatment in low- and middle-income countries. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the glivec international patient assistance program (gipap) was developed in 2002 to ensure patients with cml (chronic myeloid leukemia) or gist (gastrointestinal stromal tumor), two rare cancers, receive treatment. in partnership with the max foundation, this direct-to-patient access program has provided treatment to approximately 75 000 people since its inception.; in 2017, novartis announced the transition of this partnership to a new program called cmlpath to care™, which aims to support continued access to treatment at no cost for the nearly 34 000 previously registered patients in gipap with cml, gist and other rare cancers.; cmlpath to care™ provides glivec at no cost to patients who would not otherwise have access to treatment. the program also provides patients with access to support groups, treatment and disease information, education and emotional support to help manage their illness.; the goal is to help people living with cml, gist and other rare cancers by connecting them and their care givers with effective treatment, professional medical capabilities, trained physicians and hands-on support – based on gipap learnings.; this will be an independent program within the max foundation, which will assume responsibility from novartis for delivering treatment to these patients, including supply chain management. novartis will provide funding and drug donation support.; the collaborative agreement for cmlpath to care runs through the first quarter of 2021 with an option to extend it. during this period, novartis expects to donate more than usd 29 million to the collaboration, along with approximately 315 million doses of medicine, and to evaluate further options to sustain the program after 2021. china has a stand-alone program that support close to 30,000 patients for little or no costs.;

"60","Collaboration Helps Broaden Access to Pfizer’s Contraceptive, Sayana® Press","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; to help broaden access to a full range of contraceptive options, including subcutaneous injectables such as pfizer’s all-in-one injectable contraceptive, sayana® press (medroxyprogesterone acetate), for women most in need in some of the world’s poorest countries.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; the unmet need for contraception remains high. an estimated 225 million women in developing countries would like to delay or prevent pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception[i]. common reasons for this include difficulty travelling to health facilities, social barriers, and lack of knowledge around what contraceptive methods are available[ii].; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges ; sayana press combines a longer-acting, reversible contraceptive with the bd uniject™ injection system developed by bd. this all-in-one prefilled, single-use, auto-disable system eliminates the need to prepare a needle and syringe. it also allows the contraceptive to be administered by a health worker outside of a clinical setting, or it can be self-injected if approved locally and after health care worker instruction. the extension of their collaboration produced a 6 year agreement, during which the price is guaranteed at $0.85. after then, pfizer is committed to making sayana press affordable. ; these public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations play an important role to help ensure that women in the world’s poorest countries have access to a full range of contraceptive options. in addition to assisting with procurement, these organizations support country introductions and the delivery of a range of high quality modern contraceptive options, including subcutaneous injectable contraceptives. at the country level, the organizations also work with local governments with the goal of including modern contraceptives in reproductive health plans and budgets, coordinating health-worker trainings to improve quality counselling and services, and raising awareness about the availability of a variety of modern contraceptive options. ; partner involvement; additional collaborators supporting efforts to increase access to a full range of modern contraceptives include public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations such as united kingdom’s department for international development (dfid), unfpa, the united nations population fund, and the united states agency for international development (usaid). bd (becton, dickinson & company) is the manufacturer of the delivery system.; the public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations supporting this effort to increase access to a full range of contraceptives first collaborated in 2014 to assess demand for subcutaneous injectable options, including pfizer’s all-in-one injectable contraceptive, sayana® press (medroxyprogesterone acetate) for women most in need in some of the world’s poorest countries. in 2017, pfizer inc., the bill & melinda gates foundation, and the children’s investment fund foundation announced a multi-year extension of their collaboration to further broaden access to sayana press. sayana press will now be available to qualified purchasers at a guaranteed price of us $0.85 per dose, a reduction from the previous price of us $1.00 per dose.; list of countries involved; some of the world’s poorest countries, including countries outlined in fp2020 a global collaboration to help ensure that by 2020, an additional 120 million women have the ability to access and voluntarily use a method of modern contraception.; lessons learned; the public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations first collaborated in 2014 to assess demand for subcutaneous injectable contraceptives, including sayana press. initial pilots conducted in niger, senegal and uganda demonstrated strong demand for subcutaneous inectable contraceptives among younger women: up to 34 percent of doses administered across these three countries were to women between the ages of 20 and 24. sayana press is also attracting women who have never before used contraceptives, with 24- 42% of doses given across the pilots received by new users of family planning. [iii]; by working together to expand the range of contraceptive options available, more women in more countries have had access to them, including sayana press every year. ; summary of impact and forward looking information; by the end of 2016, 6.4 million units of sayana press were shipped to 20 developing world countries, potentially reaching more than 1.5 million women – up from 350,000 women at the end of 2014[iv]. pfizer is continuing to make investments in its manufacturing facilities to meet the expected increase in market demand.  ;

access to medicine will be made available to patients seeking treatment at public institutions with the government of kenya and roche jointly covering the costs. the aim is to ensure breast cancer patients have access to timely diagnostic services and tailored cancer treatment to make cancer therapy much more effective. planned activities for the public-private partnership with the ministry of health include breast cancer awareness programs, strengthening screening and diagnostics, training new oncologists and oncology nurses, supporting development of best practice national treatment guidelines and increasing the number of cancer treatment centers in kenya. ; “this partnership between the government of kenya and roche demonstrates that we all must play our part to ensure that our mothers, sisters and daughters have the opportunity to fight and win the war against breast cancer.” first lady margaret kenyatta; the launch builds on the country’s 2015-2020 national strategy for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and represents a comprehensive approach to battling the disease. the program also complements the campaign from the african first ladies who are committed to expanding access to prevention and treatment services for women with breast cancer.;  “this comprehensive agreement ensures that breast cancer patients in kenya will have not only improved access to care and life-changing medicines, but also that the overall healthcare system is stronger to support all kenyans battling cancer.” markus gemuend, head of roche sub-saharan africa.; roche is developing similar programs in other sub-saharan african countries, such as nigeria, ghana, sudan, côte d’ivoire and gabon. based on country needs and capabilities, roche is implementing a wide selection of activities in collaboration with local partners, including healthcare system strengthening, such as local data generation and advocacy for healthcare prioritisation;

access to medicine will be made available to patients seeking treatment at public institutions with the government of kenya and roche jointly covering the costs. the aim is to ensure breast cancer patients have access to timely diagnostic services and tailored cancer treatment to make cancer therapy much more effective. planned activities for the public-private partnership with the ministry of health include breast cancer awareness programs, strengthening screening and diagnostics, training new oncologists and oncology nurses, supporting development of best practice national treatment guidelines and increasing the number of cancer treatment centers in kenya. ; “this partnership between the government of kenya and roche demonstrates that we all must play our part to ensure that our mothers, sisters and daughters have the opportunity to fight and win the war against breast cancer.” first lady margaret kenyatta; the launch builds on the country’s 2015-2020 national strategy for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and represents a comprehensive approach to battling the disease. the program also complements the campaign from the african first ladies who are committed to expanding access to prevention and treatment services for women with breast cancer.;  “this comprehensive agreement ensures that breast cancer patients in kenya will have not only improved access to care and life-changing medicines, but also that the overall healthcare system is stronger to support all kenyans battling cancer.” markus gemuend, head of roche sub-saharan africa.;

"82","Developing Cancer Care Health Insurance","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; like many countries, china is facing a sharp increase in cancer rates. cancer is now the number one killer in urban areas and the second leading cause of death in the country as a whole. an ageing population, pollution, heavy smoking and the adoption of a western lifestyle mean that cancer will remain a major health issue in china for the foreseeable future.; as there is limited public reimbursement or private health insurance in china, most cancer patients have to pay themselves for their treatment. a full course of some cancer medicines can cost 10 times the average chinese worker's annual income. only 6% of the chinese population has a health insurance policy that covers the costs of cancer treatment. until recently, insurance policy pay-outs did not fund adequate medical care for cancer, and local insurance companies lacked the information to develop such policies.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; since 2007 roche has worked with local insurance companies in china to develop and improve health insurance coverage for cancer. through its worldwide contacts with hospitals, laboratories and healthcare networks, roche provides local and global data on cancer treatment options and cost analysis to the insurance companies. this enables insurance companies to determine an appropriate pay-out for treatment and to launch affordable cancer insurance policies that cover the best available treatment, access to hospitals and doctors, and cancer education and support.; in addition, in association with the insurance companies and a number of third parties, roche provides services such as cancer awareness and prevention programmes, treatment and care follow-up and support. such seminars, client forums and cancer awareness campaigns are helping to educate insurers and the wider population about how cancer can be treated.; working with multi-national companies to help them provide medical coverage for their employees is another activity undertaken with this partnership.; future developments include the “green channel access plan” which helps insured to get seen quicker by the relevant doctors. roche is bringing insurers and hospitals together to develop this plan.; summary of impact and forward looking information; around 40 million oncology insurance policies have been sold in china thanks to collaborations between roche and four re-insurers and 16 local insurance companies, including the three largest ones in the country. this model and associated learnings is being adapted and rolled out in over 20 countries around the world.;

in algeria, the partial epidemiologic data show that 10,000 births a year involve some form of mental disability. despite the determination of public authorities, there are still considerable areas for improvement: the lack of early screening for post-natal mental conditions; the lack of diagnosis and guidance concerning multidisciplinary treatment (medical, psychological and social); an insufficient number of public and private specialized centers; the failure to integrate disabled children into normal school classrooms; the lack of real opportunities for social and economic reinsertion; the lack of guidance for parents, who struggle to have their disabled children accepted by society.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; this action aims to strengthen three (civic society) organizations in algeria, tunisia and lebanon that represent people living with mental disabilities, with a view to transferring skills.; the program involves supporting medical-social actions in the field through the development of vocational training, giving guidance to families, and sharing experiences and practices among associations.; lessons learned; working with local health authorities and local organizations (ngo, unions) makes the program stronger and long-lasting. futhermore, the government must integrate in their national health action plan, early diagnosis, care and integration of children/people with mental disabilities.;

"91","Doulas and Midwives: Key Professions for Reducing Maternal & Neonatal Mortality","XXX; ; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; kampong speu is the poorest province in cambodia where there is only very limited access to medical care, especially obstetric and neonatal care. the referral hospital to accommodate pregnancies with complications is more than 100 km from the remotest village. health services lack staff and equipment. midwifery skills are not up to the needs and their availability and their relationships with patients from the villages cannot ensure high quality monitoring of pregnancies.; due to this lack of access, facilities and knowledge, village women still do not use health services very frequently. less than half of all deliveries are carried out by competent persons. there is also a very low level of education in the villages and many beliefs and practices that are harmful to mothers and their babies still persist.; in 2010, the maternal mortality rate in the province of kampong speu was 206 per 100,000 births and the neonatal mortality rate was 31 per 1,000 live births, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas.; to achieve the millennium development goals 4 and 5, the ministry of health has implemented a plan to improve emergency obstetric and neonatal care, based on improving and extending the skills in certain health centers so that they become referral facilities for emergency care. however, a large number of training courses will still be required to reach this level of care.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; this project aims to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality by stepping up care services, especially in obstetric and neonatal emergencies, and provide better resources for communities. it is based on two complementary actions: training midwives to improve the quality of services in hospitals and health centers and training village doulas to inform and support women during pregnancy and the first months of their babies’ lives.;

"95","Drug Discovery Project for Chagas Disease","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; develop new drugs for neglected tropical diseases (ntds) and tuberculosis (tb).; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; according to the world health organization (who), ntds blight the lives of more than 1 billion of the world's poorest 2.4 billion people. there are 149 countries and territories where ntds are endemic, at least 100 of which are endemic for 2 or more of these diseases, and 30 countries and territories of which are endemic for 6 or more. these diseases not only survive and spread in conditions of poverty but also anchor large populations in poverty.; chagas disease is transmitted by the bite of the assassin bug or vinchuca and is particularly endemic in poorer areas of latin america and the caribbean. approximately 8 million people are believed to carry the disease and 100 million people are estimated to be living in endemic areas. in latin america alone, about 14,000 people die from chagas disease on average each year, meaning that the development of a novel treatment for this disease exists as a high unmet medical need.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; eisai has announced a global agreement with the broad institute, a collaborative research facility that includes researchers from harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), to jointly discover and develop new therapeutic agents for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases (ntds) and tuberculosis.; under the agreement, eisai and broad will collaborate together on drug discovery initiatives toward novel treatments for ntds and tuberculosis through optimization of compounds screened from broad's chemical library. the first project will conduct drug discovery research aimed at the creation of a novel treatment for chagas disease.; this first project for the treatment of chagas disease has also been awarded a grant for partial funding by the global health innovative technology fund (ghit fund), an international nonprofit organization aimed to advance the research and development of new health technologies from japan to fight infectious diseases prevalent specifically in the developing world, including hiv/aids, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases (ntds). established as a public-private partnership between the government of japan, a consortium of pharmaceutical companies (including eisai), and the bill & melinda gates foundation, the ghit fund facilitates and funds research and development of new health technologies. to view more of eisai's ghit fund projects, click here.;

an external review from the swiss tropical and public health institute (swiss tph) of tdr’s career development fellowship has found the program has an impact on a broad range of factors, with ample future potential for continued growth and extension. altogether, 95% of survey respondents think that their skills and competencies in good clinical or laboratory practices were “better” or “much better” at the end of the program.; tdr and edctp launched their first joint call on 31 october 2014. 20 product development organizations offered to host fellows in 2015, including astellas, bayer, gsk, novartis, merck, sanofi and sanofi pasteur. the host organisations trained scientists – for a period of up to 24 months – to develop specialist product development skills not readily taught in academic centres or public research institutions. on returning to their home organizations, the fellows are expected to become an important resource for institutional capacity development to undertake and manage clinical research in accordance with international regulatory requirements and standards.; cdf fellows have come from 19 african countries: benin, burkina faso, botswana, cameroon, democratic republic of the congo, ethiopia, gabon, ghana, guinea, kenya, the gambia, madagascar, mali, nigeria, senegal, swaziland, tanzania, uganda and zimbabwe. others have come from china, colombia, peru and vietnam.; a second joint call was launched on the 22 october 2015 and a third joint call was launched in october 2016, for which merck is confirmed as host organization. ; up until 2013, eisai also participated in the edctp-tdr clinical research development fellowships. eisai had tdr program twice: once in 2010-2011 and then 2011-2012. ;","astellas;

as part of this effort, fight the fakes is collecting resources and updates on this issue and is encouraging the public to help speak up and spread the word about this threat to patients. the website also serves as a resource for organizations and individuals who are looking to support this effort by outlining opportunities for action and sharing what others are doing to fight fake medicines.; fight the fakes looks to the leadership of the world health organization’s (who) member state mechanism on substandard/spurious/falsely-labelled/falsified/counterfeit medical products in guiding the direction of the campaign.; since its launch in november 2013, fight the fakes has grown from 10 founding members to 33 partner organisations. this includes doctors, nurses, pharmacists, research institutes, ngos and foundations, coalitions for consumer protection, product development partnerships (pdps), disease-specific organizations, mobile app services, wholesalers and the researched-based and generic pharmaceutical industries. the fight the fakes website serves as a hub for resources about fake medicines, for updates on news, developments and technology, and for ‘stories from the frontline.’; the campaign has been represented by partners at events on drug regulation, malaria eradication, anti-counterfeiting, the role of the media in public health and the 69th world health assembly.   ; fight the fakes has a growing presence on social media and has established itself as a key player in worldwide efforts against counterfeit medicines. ;","fake medicines put patients and the general public at risk. patients believe they are receiving genuine treatment, but instead they are getting potentially dangerous products that could increase resistance to real treatments, and cause further illness, disability or even death. though it is a challenge to measure the scope of these dangerous products, the world health organization (who) estimates that fake medicines can account for up to 10% of medicines in the supply chain globally, and up to 30% of the drug supply chain in parts of asia, africa and latin america.; fake medicines may contain the wrong ingredients, the wrong dose, or no active ingredients at all; they can be long-standing or new medicines, over-the-counter or prescription, branded or generic. in some cases they contain dangerous substances and poisons including mercury, antifreeze, paint and rat poison.; fake medicines used to treat communicable diseases such as malaria can also undermine entire public health initiatives by exposing communities to greater drug resistance. in southeast asia and sub saharan africa, 35% of anti-malarials failed chemical analysis, jeopardizing progress and investments in combatting this disease.;

"129","Freedom of Breath, Fountain of Life","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; birth asphyxia— an inability to breathe at birth — happens with approximately one out of every 10 babies. birth asphyxia is a major cause of infant mortality and can contribute to developmental issues such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:; johnson & johnson has programs that address birth asphyxia in china, ethiopia, ghana, india, indonesia, kenya, malawi, nepal, pakistan, south africa, uganda and vietnam. the largest of these is china’s neonatal resuscitation program (nrp), also known as freedom of breath, fountain of life.  since 2010, professionals and other birth attendants trained through these programs have touched the lives of more than 12.6 million women and children. johnson & johnson is committed to continue to focus on providing hands-on training to local hospitals and clinics to reduce mortality in situations where basic training can save a life.;

"130","GAVI Alliance","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS ; with 20% of the world's children not vaccinated, the gavi alliance is seeking to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. each year, 1.7 million children die from a vaccine-preventable disease. the overwhelming majority of these deaths occur in developing countries. that's one life every 20 seconds. twenty-three million children in developing countries do not receive life-saving vaccines that parents in wealthy nations take for granted.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the gavi alliance was founded in 2000 by the bill & melinda gates foundation, the world bank, the who, unicef and vaccine manufacturers, including sanofi pasteur, pfizer, msd, gsk, novartis, and janssen pharmaceutical companies (previouslly called crucell) of johnson & johnson. committed to saving children’s lives and protecting people’s health through the widespread use of vaccines, gavi’s driving objective is to make a critical contribution to global immunization goals by supporting immunization programs and health systems, and accelerating the introduction of new vaccines.; gavi addresses three critical gaps in the provision of vaccines:; gavi supports new and underused vaccines, health system strengthening, immunization services, injection safety and civil society organizations in total, gavi has committed usd 7.2 billion since 2000. eighty (80) percent has been committed towards the purchase of vaccines. the gavi fund provides financial support to low-income countries, based upon applications to and recommendations by the gavi alliance board. besides, industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. they also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.; the gavi alliance has also organized a major initiative to contain the risk of yellow fever epidemics. since 2003, the group has provided more than six million doses per year of yellow fever vaccines funded by gavi to go toward emergency stockpiles of vaccines, in order to prevent epidemics in africa.; other challenges include: ensuring contributions of all the board partners; gavi and industry constituency governance processes and transparency, management of coi (conflict of interest), improving demand forecast by gavi to help industry align supply projections, and risk management by gavi to ensure that funds are properly used in countries. unicef policy of supply security and contracts with manufacturers allows for minimal, if any, interruption of immunization programs, coordination within the global vaccine policy wg (including formal governance procedure related to gavi work) ensures that all individual companies contribute their knowledge and positions, and all voices are heard and communicated.; gavi achievements in 2015:; industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. they also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.; janssen activities ; janssen support for gavi includes supplying large quantities of the first internationally available thiomersal-preservative free, fully liquid pentavalent (5-in-1) vaccine quinvaxem™, which protects children against 5 diseases (dtp-hepb-hib) in one single shot. since 2006, janssen supplied more than 270 million doses of quinvaxem™ to the world's poorest countries at discounted prices, including consistent supply when other pentavalent vaccines manufacturers were unable to do so.; from 2011 to 2014 janssen's ceo represented the industrialized countries vaccine manufacturers constituency on the gavi board. from 2008 to 2011 janssen served on the gavi program & policy committee.; glaxosmithkline activities; gsk is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of vaccines: in 2013, they distributed over 860 million doses of vaccines to some 170 countriesa and 80% of these vaccines were delivered to people low income and middle income countries. for the last decade,gsk  has been the primary supplier of vaccines to unicef which purchases vaccines on behalf of gavi. the gavi alliance benefits from gsk’s lowest prices as part of its tiered pricing approach. this approach is designed to support those countries which commit to vaccination for the long term and implement programs aimed at reaching large proportions of the target population. tiered pricing reflects the fundamental value of immunisation as an investment in health. it also reflects gsk’s desire to enable countries to maintain and expand upon their commitment to immunisation as their economies grow. for the least well-off countries, gsk works closely with gavi and unicef to improve access to vaccines.; in 2016, as a demonstration of gsk’s commitment to increase access to vaccines that can help save children’s lives in the world’s poorest countries, gsk offered a further eduction in the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, synflorix, to gavi, the vaccine alliance. gsk has a portfolio of more than 30 vaccines; these include vaccines against cervical cancer, rotavirus and pneumococcal disease, each of them highly innovative and each supported by gavi. ; in 2014, gsk announced that it would freeze the prices of its vaccines for five years for developing countries that graduate from gavi alliance support.; in 2013, a 2 dose schedule of gsk’s cervarix was licensed in europe and some other countries for girls 9-14 years. many countries face significant challenges in implementing national immunisation programmes in young adults and so a two-dosing schedule has the potential to be easier to deliver than a three-dose schedule.; since 2002 gsk has supported the work of the network for education and support in immunization (nesi) to promote vaccinology training for healthcare workers in sub-saharan africa, north africa and the middle east. nesi has become a key partner of organizations such as the who, unicef and gavi who implement vaccination programs in these regions.   in sudan, gsk contributed to the introduction of the rotarix vaccine by supporting social mobilization and training in partnership with the ministry of health. in zambia, gsk supported the program for the awareness and elimination of diarrhea by donating rotarix to vaccinate over 84,000 children in the district of lusaka. this pilot project should be leveraged to develop capacity for national co-introduction of rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines. gsk has also cervarix, cervical cancer vaccine, which will be made available in developing countries with help from gavi. gsk also is developing new vaccines for diseases which are future gavi targets, including dengue and malaria.; msd activities ; msd aims to achieve the broadest possible access to our vaccines within a sustainable framework—one that allows ongoing research, development, and distribution of innovative vaccines that address important unmet health needs. we do so through a comprehensive strategy that includes working with governments to build vaccination delivery programs that reliably reach people and also tiered (or differential) pricing–systematically pricing vaccines at differing levels appropriate to the value they create under the economic conditions where they are used–to facilitate broad access.; msd has supplied over 4 million doses of gardasil® [human papillomavirus quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine, recombinant] and over 18 million doses of rotateq® (rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, pentavalent) to gavi through unicef from 2012-2016. ; in low-income countries, msd offers rotateq and gardasil at an access price that is the lowest available price in the world. the access price is exclusive to the public sectors of gavi-eligible countries meeting the needs of the developing world by facilitating access to these innovative vaccines in the poorest countries, while making sure they remain affordable and sustainable in the long term.  for more developed middle-income countries, msd practices differential pricing that considers many factors, including countries' ability to pay and others.; msd is committed to working with partners, including gavi, to improve access to gardasil and rotateq in developing countries.  ; in 2015, msd committed to gavi to extend its 2015 gavi prices for gardasil and rotateq to gavi graduated countries. this renewed commitment to gavi enables these countries to achieve continued access to our vaccines for 10 years (21016-2025).; in 2010, in partnership with the government of bhutan, the australian cervical cancer foundation, msd began providing gardasil to eligible girls in the country.  more than 90% of targeted girls were vaccinated with three doses of the vaccine in the first year of the program.; in 2011, in a partnership with the government of rwanda, msd began providing gardasil to , as part of a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention that included both hpv vaccination and hpv dna testing.  more than 96% of targeted girls were vaccinated with three doses of gardasil in 2011 and 2012.  this program has now fully transitioned to gavi support. in addition, msd through its partnership with pink ribbon red ribbon (prrr) continues to work to address cervical cancer in sub-saharan africa through comprehensive approaches to cervical cancer prevention and control, including hpv vaccination.  this effort includes a program launched in coordination with the zambian government, local ngos, the us government and prrr partners, focused on the scale up of breast and cervical cancer education to increase knowledge and awareness and reduce stigma throughout zambia.  msd also supported the zambian ministry of health’s plans to conduct an hpv vaccine demonstration project across the province of lusaka by providing 180,000 doses of gardasil to vaccinate 50,000 eligible girls over two years, and provided technical support for the program. plans are underway by the zambian government to transition to a national hpv vaccination program with gavi support.; from 2006-2009, msd worked with the nicaraguan ministry of health on an innovative partnership to vaccinate all infants born in nicaragua during this time period against rotavirus.  this program, which was completed in 2009 and transitioned to gavi funding in 2010, achieved an estimated 94 percent vaccine coverage (with 3 doses) among nicaraguan infants.  msd continues to participate in unicef tender to supply gardasil and rotateq to developing countries with gavi support.  msd’s partnership with gavi and other alliance partners is helping to ensure that infants and girls in the poorest countries have sustainable access to these vaccines.; pfizer activities ; in march 2010, pfizer entered into the first of three 10-year supply agreements under the terms of the amc to supply 300m doses of pcv 13 for pneumococcal disease (pd). subsequently, pfizer entered into two additional agreements with the amc expanding its commitment with an additional 440 million doses, for a total commitment of 740 million doses of the first 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine until 2025.; in addition to expanding its commitment, pfizer further reduced the amc “tail price” price for prevenar 13 to $3.40 for 2013 and $3.30 for all subsequent years through 2025. the amc is a public-private health funding program designed to create a sustainable marketplace, ensure an affordable and stable supply of pneumococcal vaccines at a steeply discounted price and stimulate the development and expansion of manufacturing capacity for vaccines specifically for the world's poorest countries.  pfizer was proud to introduce its vaccine into the childhood immunization program of a developing country within one year of its launch in the united states and european union — a historic precedent given the average 10–15 year lag for introducing newer vaccines into developing countries following their introduction in industrialized nations. as of december 2013, prevenar 13 is now available in 40 gavi eligible countries.; nicaragua, the first gavi country to launch a pcv vaccine, has demonstrated a reduction of infant mortality by 33% just two years after launch.  pfizer is proud to be a partner in the gavi alliance and to contribute to the reduction of infant mortality and to help avert over 500,000 future deaths from pneumococcal disease by 2015.; sanofi activities; sanofi pasteur is a longstanding partner of gavi in the supply of several  vaccines. in light of gavi decisions to support implementation of inactivated polio vaccine (ipv) in routine immunization, this partnership has expanded further via the supply of unparalleled quantities of affordable ipv to support rapid & widespread adoption of the vaccine across 73 of the world’s poorest countries, hand-in-hand with the global polio eradication initiative (gpei) - another key public-private partnership spearheaded by who.; sanofi pasteur is a leading supplier of yellow fever vaccines, used in icg (international coordination group) funded vaccines stockpile for emergency outbreak response, for mass campaigns and routine use in africa and latin america.  shantha biologics - a sanofi company - supplies a well adapted fully liquid ready-to-use oral vaccine against cholera, recognised as an important tool in the control of this disease which is estimated to  kill up to 100 000 people every year, around half of whom are in africa.  the gavi alliance financed the supply of vaccine for outbreak situations and campaigns in areas of recurring disease in 2014. shantha's pentavalent paediatric combination vaccine, dtp-hepb-hib is added to the list of manufacturers able and ready to supply pre-qualified a key vaccine in gavi's strategy.; part of sanofi pasteur’s contribution to the gavi alliance is its support of the epivacplus program. implemented by the agence de médecine préventive (amp), all program activities are implemented in collaboration with governments of partner countries, international health organizations, and african and european universities. in this way, epivacplus constitutes an effective international, public-private partnership, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving immunization program performance. the program trains doctors involved in the implementation of immunization programs in eleven central and west african countries.  by providing medical personnel with crucial training in epidemiology, applied computing, vaccinology, and management of health programs, this diploma course in organization and management of immunization in developing countries will help improve access to vaccines.; gavi addresses three critical gaps in the provision of vaccines:; gavi supports new and underused vaccines, health system strengthening, immunization services, injection safety and civil society organizations in total, gavi has committed usd 7.2 billion since 2000. eighty (80) percent has been committed towards the purchase of vaccines. the gavi fund provides financial support to low-income countries, based upon applications to and recommendations by the gavi alliance board. besides, industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. they also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.;

in addition to expanding its commitment, pfizer further reduced the amc “tail price” price for prevenar 13 to $3.40 for 2013 and $3.30 for all subsequent years through 2025. the amc is a public-private health funding program designed to create a sustainable marketplace, ensure an affordable and stable supply of pneumococcal vaccines at a steeply discounted price and stimulate the development and expansion of manufacturing capacity for vaccines specifically for the world's poorest countries.  pfizer was proud to introduce its vaccine into the childhood immunization program of a developing country within one year of its launch in the united states and european union — a historic precedent given the average 10–15 year lag for introducing newer vaccines into developing countries following their introduction in industrialized nations. as of december 2013, prevenar 13 is now available in 40 gavi eligible countries.; nicaragua, the first gavi country to launch a pcv vaccine, has demonstrated a reduction of infant mortality by 33% just two years after launch.  pfizer is proud to be a partner in the gavi alliance and to contribute to the reduction of infant mortality and to help avert over 500,000 future deaths from pneumococcal disease by 2015.; sanofi activities; sanofi pasteur is a longstanding partner of gavi in the supply of several  vaccines. in light of gavi decisions to support implementation of inactivated polio vaccine (ipv) in routine immunization, this partnership has expanded further via the supply of unparalleled quantities of affordable ipv to support rapid & widespread adoption of the vaccine across 73 of the world’s poorest countries, hand-in-hand with the global polio eradication initiative (gpei) - another key public-private partnership spearheaded by who.; sanofi pasteur is a leading supplier of yellow fever vaccines, used in icg (international coordination group) funded vaccines stockpile for emergency outbreak response, for mass campaigns and routine use in africa and latin america.  shantha biologics - a sanofi company - supplies a well adapted fully liquid ready-to-use oral vaccine against cholera, recognised as an important tool in the control of this disease which is estimated to  kill up to 100 000 people every year, around half of whom are in africa.  the gavi alliance financed the supply of vaccine for outbreak situations and campaigns in areas of recurring disease in 2014. shantha's pentavalent paediatric combination vaccine, dtp-hepb-hib is added to the list of manufacturers able and ready to supply pre-qualified a key vaccine in gavi's strategy.; part of sanofi pasteur’s contribution to the gavi alliance is its support of the epivacplus program. implemented by the agence de médecine préventive (amp), all program activities are implemented in collaboration with governments of partner countries, international health organizations, and african and european universities. in this way, epivacplus constitutes an effective international, public-private partnership, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving immunization program performance. the program trains doctors involved in the implementation of immunization programs in eleven central and west african countries.  by providing medical personnel with crucial training in epidemiology, applied computing, vaccinology, and management of health programs, this diploma course in organization and management of immunization in developing countries will help improve access to vaccines.; gavi addresses three critical gaps in the provision of vaccines:; gavi supports new and underused vaccines, health system strengthening, immunization services, injection safety and civil society organizations in total, gavi has committed usd 7.2 billion since 2000. eighty (80) percent has been committed towards the purchase of vaccines. the gavi fund provides financial support to low-income countries, based upon applications to and recommendations by the gavi alliance board. besides, industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. they also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.; the gavi alliance has also organized a major initiative to contain the risk of yellow fever epidemics. since 2003, the group has provided more than six million doses per year of yellow fever vaccines funded by gavi to go toward emergency stockpiles of vaccines, in order to prevent epidemics in africa.; other challenges include: ensuring contributions of all the board partners; gavi and industry constituency governance processes and transparency, management of coi (conflict of interest), improving demand forecast by gavi to help industry align supply projections, and risk management by gavi to ensure that funds are properly used in countries. unicef policy of supply security and contracts with manufacturers allows for minimal, if any, interruption of immunization programs, coordination within the global vaccine policy wg (including formal governance procedure related to gavi work) ensures that all individual companies contribute their knowledge and positions, and all voices are heard and communicated.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the largest of novartis’ oncology access programs – the glivec international patient assistance program (gipap) is a direct-to-patient access program – developed to ensure patients with cml (chronic myeloid leukemia) or gist (gastrointestinal stromal tumour), two rare cancers, receive treatment.; gipap’s aim is to provide breakthrough drug, glivec, at no cost to patients with certain forms of cml and gist, who would not otherwise have access to treatment. gipap also provides patients with access to support groups, treatment and disease information, education and emotional support to help manage their illness. more than 60,000 patients from 80 countries have benefi­tted from gipap to date, the program is viewed as one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching cancer access programs ever developed on a global scale.; novartis partners with physicians and international health organizations to facilitate access to glivec via gipap. to reach as many cml and gist patients in need as possible in low and middle income countries, gipap partners have established clear roles for the partners and a clear process for the program, engaged local governments and officials, and educated local partners to gain their support and commitment. the roles of the key partners are:; the max foundation:; axios international:;  novartis:; early engagement with governments in gipap countries is essential and clear program criteria are vital to the success of a program of this size and ambition. equally important is clarity on the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved along with standard operating procedures to standardize processes across many disparate countries. education on the program for physicians, governments, patients, distributors and others involved is also crucial.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the global alliance for tb drug development (tb alliance), established in 2000, brings together industry, ngos, governments, foundations and more than 30 partners around the world to accelerate the discovery and development of cost-effective new medicines. the tb alliance draws on the best practices and resources of the public and private sectors to accelerate the discovery and development of cost-effective new anti-tb medicines, which should shorten or simplify treatment, provide a more effective treatment of multidrug-resistant tb and improve treatment of latent tb infection.; the founders of the tb alliance are the bill and melinda gates foundation, the rockefeller foundation, the us agency for international development (usaid), irish aid, the netherlands' ministry of foreign affairs and the uk department of international development (dfid). company partners include astrazeneca, bayer healthcare, glaxosmithkline and novartis.; the partnership functions as a virtual r&d organization. by outsourcing medicine research and development projects, medicine compounds are moved along the development line to achieve regulatory approval and bring them to market at affordable prices for those countries experiencing the highest burden from tb. tb alliance activities in low and middle income countries include clinical trials in kenya, south africa and zambia and non-clinical or preclinical work in china and india.; the current six-month standard treatment period for tb is based on four medicines that were discovered over 40 years ago. medicines must be taken for 6 to 8 months, frequently under the direct supervision of healthcare professionals as directly observed therapy– short course (dots). a reduced tb treatment regimen should help improve patient compliance, reduce treatment failure rates and decrease the tb-related health costs in endemic disease countries.; pre-clinical studies have shown that moxifloxacin can reduce the treatment period by two months, if it is administered in place of isoniazid – one of the pillars of current tb treatment. the results of clinical phase-ii studies support the treatment reduction potential of moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin is currently approved in 123 countries for the treatment of acute bacterial infections but is currently not approved for the treatment of tb, including multi-drug resistant tb (mdr-tb).; moxifloxacin is currently being assessed in a large, phase-iii study (remoxtb) which may result in the registration of the first new drug approved for the treatment of drug-sensitive tb in nearly 50 years. in all studies, bayer has made the antibiotic moxifloxacin available free of charge and in cases of positive results will also bear the costs for the approval procedures. to learn more about these trails, click here.; if the data from the clinical trial is positive, tb alliance and bayer healthcare will seek registration of moxifloxacin as part of a multi-drug regimen for drug-sensitive tb and work to make it widely adopted into existing tb treatment programs, and available and affordable to patients who most need it.;

found in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of africa, asia, the pacific, the middle east and the americas, lf is one of the world’s leading causes of disability. it is characterised by severe swelling of the legs and arms and skin infections, and many people affected are unable to work and therefore forced into a life of poverty.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the global alliance to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (gaelf) was created to eliminate one of the world's leading causes of disability and disfigurement as a public health problem by the year 2020. an estimated 120 million people suffer from the disease, and nearly one billion are at risk of infection. the project involves national ministries of health of the endemic countries.; initiated by the world health organization (who) and glaxosmithkline in 1998, the global alliance has evolved into a global partnership between international organizations in the public and private sectors, academia and non-governmental organizations working in partnership with ministries of health in tropical countries where lymphatic filariasis (lf) is endemic. msd joined the elimination effort in 1998, when it widened the scope of the mectizan® (ivermectin) donation program to include lf in african countries where river blindness and lf co-exist.; the who recommends that lymphatic filariasis be prevented with a combination of albendazole (donated by gsk) with either dec or mectizan® (donated by msd). mass drug administration for people living in endemic areas is recommended by who once a year for at least five years to break the cycle of transmission.; in order to ensure that lf elimination programs use resources effectively, the global program places great emphasis on integration with other public health programs. linkages are pursued with programs that use similar strategies – such as bed nets for malaria control, and drugs for controlling intestinal parasites, schistosomiasis and river blindness.; additionally, non-governmental development organizations complement the efforts of the national ministries of health in implementing different components of the programs within their specific competence and scope.;

"143","Global HOPE (Hematology-Oncology Pediatric Excellence)","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES ; global hope (hematology-oncology pediatric excellence) is a comprehensive initiative which will build long-term capacity to treat and dramatically improve the prognosis of thousands of children with cancer and blood disorders in southern and eastern africa.;  ; ; ; ; ;NEEDS ; in the united states, 80 percent of children with cancer survive. in sub-saharan africa, the overwhelming majority of pediatric patients do not survive. the mortality rate is estimated to be as high as 90 percent, meaning that thousands of children die from cancer across africa each year. this is in large part due to an inadequate healthcare infrastructure and a significant lack of expert physicians and other healthcare workers trained to treat children with cancer. the most common types of childhood cancers are blood cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma. ; there are only five pediatric oncologists currently in the countries of botswana, malawi and uganda combined, there are simply not enough expert doctors to treat all the children diagnosed with blood disorders and cancer. it is estimated that in these countries there are more than 11,000 new cases annually of pediatric cancer and 40,000 new cases of serious, life-threatening blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and hemophilia. because of these staggering numbers, more healthcare providers with special expertise are urgently needed. global hope will help build capacity in the region to diagnose and care for children with blood disorders and cancer, offering the potential for transformational change in survivorship for these children.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges ; the bristol-myers squibb foundation is committing $50 million over five years to fund the training of healthcare providers as well as clinical infrastructure and operations. bipai will raise an additional $50 million for the initiative.; global hope will partner with local governments and ministries of health to build medical capacity to diagnose and treat pediatric blood disorders and cancer in botswana, malawi and uganda. the initiative will also create significant clinical, educational and research capabilities. doctors, nurses and ancillary professionals will be recruited from around the world to provide training to local healthcare professionals and to begin treating children with blood disorders and cancer immediately.; botswana and uganda will also serve as regional hubs for pediatric hematology-oncology.; summary of impact and forward looking information; as public-private partnerships, the various governments will each play an important role in developing the pediatric hematology-oncology network, assisting with the training, technical assistance, logistics and resources to support global hope.; the global hope initiative will train an estimated 4,800 healthcare professionals from botswana, uganda, malawi and other african countries, including doctors, nurses, social workers and other health care workers involved in the treatment, care and support continuum of high qualitypediatric hematology-oncology. the program estimates that over 5,000 children will receive care in the first five years.; the global hope initiative will be modeled on the work of the bristol-myers squibb foundation, bipai and the governments of botswana, uganda and malawi, which created the largest pediatric hiv treatment network in the world, leveraging existing experience, infrastructure, and public/private partnerships created through the initiative. since 2003, the bristol-myers squibb foundation and bipai have trained 52,000 healthcare professionals and currently provide care for nearly 300,000 children with hiv and their families in sub-saharan africa, lowering the mortality rate for these children to 1.2 percent.;

"145","Global Polio Eradication Initiative","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; polio (poliomyelitis) is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. it invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. the strategy to eradicate polio is therefore based on preventing infection by immunizing every child until transmission stops and the world is polio-free.; though this disease has nearly disappeared from the collective consciousness, it continues to trigger epidemic outbreaks in certain countries of sub-saharan africa and central/south asia. although the number of cases has dropped by over 99% since 1988, polio remains a devastating disease for the people it strikes. polio is still endemic in three countries (nigeria, afghanistan, pakistan) and the infection has reappeared in several countries. that is how, since 2003, annual case numbers have fluctuated between 1000 and 2000, and between 12 and 23 countries every year have reported polio cases due to imported polioviruses. in light of the current situation, the challenge for sanofi pasteur is to continue to play a decisive role in eradicating the disease.; from 2017, if no cases of wild polio are detected for three years, the time the virus can survive outside the body, the world will be officially declared polio free. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; since 1988, the global polio eradication initiative, spearheaded by who, rotary international, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and unicef -- with additional support from the bill & melinda gates foundation -- has achieved a 99% reduction of the number of polio cases worldwide. polio is caused by three strains of poliovirus, types 1, 2 and 3. wild poliovirus type 2 has already been eliminated, and it is hoped that poliovirus type 1 and 3 will be eradicated within a few years, definitively wiping polio from the surface of the earth.; in 2013 sanofi announced its commitment to provide 1.7 billion doses of oral polio vaccine (opv) to support the global polio eradication initiative’s (gpei) strategy to eradicate polio this decade. the doses of opv will be delivered through 2017 for gpei polio vaccination program.; sanofi pasteur, as a leader in providing both opv and ipv (inactivated poliovirus vaccine), has been a partner of the global polio eradication initiative for over 20 years. the company has provided more than six billion doses of opv to unicef over last two decades.; when an epidemic broke out in egypt and at the request of the who, the group developed the first monovalent oral polio vaccine, which contributed to eliminating the disease in this country.  ; in 1982, sanofi pasteur registered the first enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (ipv), which is now distributed globally as a stand-alone poliovirus vaccine as well as in combination with pediatric vaccines to immunize against many diseases in a single shot. since then, sanofi pasteur has distributed more than 1 billion doses of ipv and ipv-containing vaccines. ; sanofi pasteur has made significant investments in modern technology to produce very large quantities of ipv -- up to 300 million doses a year. as well as this substantial investment in production capacity, sanofi pasteur support to ipv now includes development of a five-dose vial presentation (as well as the standard ten-dose vial presentation) to reduce wastage, a massive regulatory and licensing program in about 100 countries and expert contributions on scientific, program and technical questions.; in 2015, sanofi pasteur and the bill and melinda gates foundation began offering a new ipv pricing structure so that 120 new countries can be provided with large quantities of high-quality vaccines at low cost to ensure their rapid and widespread adoption.; lessons learned              ; the eradication of polio needs a global approach. first, it must include all endemic countries but also have an approach of countries with re-established transmission as well as those susceptible to import the disease. in addition of the vaccine supply, a strong political engagement is crucial but also the mobilization of the community and oversight community mobilization.; summary of impact and forward looking information; huge achievements have been made in the global fight against polio since 1988, when the world health assembly resolved to eradicate the disease. the number of polio cases worldwide has decreased by more than 99%, from 350 000 in 1988 to just 36 cases in 2016 – a 99.9% decrease in the number of cases worldwide between 1988 and 2016. over 2.5 billion children have been vaccinated and an estimated 10 million people have been saved from polio-related paralysis.; when the initiative was first launched in in 1988, the virus was endemic in 125 countries. today. this is only true of two countries: afghanistan and pakistan. the last case of polio in africa was reported in somalia in august 2014. since then, no new cases have been recorded anywhere on the continent, representing a major advance in the eradication of the disease. in september 2015, the who announced that nigeria had been removed from the list of endemic countries.; sanofi pasteur will continue to maintain its important historic role and commitment to vaccination. in the future, the group is convinced that the use of injectable vaccines will increase. sanofi pasteur offers an industrial solution that enables mass production of ipv on a global scale. following the eradication of smallpox, polio is expected to be the second infection to be eradicated worldwide.;

when the initiative was first launched in in 1988, the virus was endemic in 125 countries. today. this is only true of two countries: afghanistan and pakistan. the last case of polio in africa was reported in somalia in august 2014. since then, no new cases have been recorded anywhere on the continent, representing a major advance in the eradication of the disease. in september 2015, the who announced that nigeria had been removed from the list of endemic countries.; sanofi pasteur will continue to maintain its important historic role and commitment to vaccination. in the future, the group is convinced that the use of injectable vaccines will increase. sanofi pasteur offers an industrial solution that enables mass production of ipv on a global scale. following the eradication of smallpox, polio is expected to be the second infection to be eradicated worldwide.;  ;","polio (poliomyelitis) is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. it invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. the strategy to eradicate polio is therefore based on preventing infection by immunizing every child until transmission stops and the world is polio-free.; though this disease has nearly disappeared from the collective consciousness, it continues to trigger epidemic outbreaks in certain countries of sub-saharan africa and central/south asia. although the number of cases has dropped by over 99% since 1988, polio remains a devastating disease for the people it strikes. polio is still endemic in three countries (nigeria, afghanistan, pakistan) and the infection has reappeared in several countries. that is how, since 2003, annual case numbers have fluctuated between 1000 and 2000, and between 12 and 23 countries every year have reported polio cases due to imported polioviruses. in light of the current situation, the challenge for sanofi pasteur is to continue to play a decisive role in eradicating the disease.; from 2017, if no cases of wild polio are detected for three years, the time the virus can survive outside the body, the world will be officially declared polio free. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; since 1988, the global polio eradication initiative, spearheaded by who, rotary international, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and unicef -- with additional support from the bill & melinda gates foundation -- has achieved a 99% reduction of the number of polio cases worldwide. polio is caused by three strains of poliovirus, types 1, 2 and 3. wild poliovirus type 2 has already been eliminated, and it is hoped that poliovirus type 1 and 3 will be eradicated within a few years, definitively wiping polio from the surface of the earth.; in 2013 sanofi announced its commitment to provide 1.7 billion doses of oral polio vaccine (opv) to support the global polio eradication initiative’s (gpei) strategy to eradicate polio this decade. the doses of opv will be delivered through 2017 for gpei polio vaccination program.; sanofi pasteur, as a leader in providing both opv and ipv (inactivated poliovirus vaccine), has been a partner of the global polio eradication initiative for over 20 years. the company has provided more than six billion doses of opv to unicef over last two decades.; when an epidemic broke out in egypt and at the request of the who, the group developed the first monovalent oral polio vaccine, which contributed to eliminating the disease in this country.  ; in 1982, sanofi pasteur registered the first enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (ipv), which is now distributed globally as a stand-alone poliovirus vaccine as well as in combination with pediatric vaccines to immunize against many diseases in a single shot. since then, sanofi pasteur has distributed more than 1 billion doses of ipv and ipv-containing vaccines. ; sanofi pasteur has made significant investments in modern technology to produce very large quantities of ipv -- up to 300 million doses a year. as well as this substantial investment in production capacity, sanofi pasteur support to ipv now includes development of a five-dose vial presentation (as well as the standard ten-dose vial presentation) to reduce wastage, a massive regulatory and licensing program in about 100 countries and expert contributions on scientific, program and technical questions.; in 2015, sanofi pasteur and the bill and melinda gates foundation began offering a new ipv pricing structure so that 120 new countries can be provided with large quantities of high-quality vaccines at low cost to ensure their rapid and widespread adoption.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; in march 2005, glaxosmithkline and the global alliance for tb drug development (tb alliance) announced a joint discovery partnership to improve the treatment of tuberculosis (tb). the tb alliance supports 15 full-time scientists working exclusively on the tb drug program at the gsk r&d facility in tres cantos, spain. gsk contributes at least a matching number of staff and all remaining overhead costs.  to achieve global control of this epidemic, there is an urgent need for new tb drugs, which can: (1) shorten treatment duration; (2) target mdr or xdr strains; (3) simplify treatment by reducing the daily pill burden; (4) lower dosing frequency (for example, a once-weekly regimen); and (5) be co-administered with hiv medications.; around 2 million compounds have been tested for anti-tb activity and any medicines discovered will be made as affordable and accessible as possible to those most in need. a strategic combination of single-enzyme targets and phenotypic screen hits is expected to be a successful strategy and the program broadens the worldwide tb medicine pipeline by adding several novel classes of compounds with new mechanisms of action. drug candidates arising from these projects could treat patients who are resistant to conventional therapies.; the joint research program consists of a mini-portfolio projects intended to yield new compounds that attack mycobacterium tuberculosis (m.tb) on multiple levels. the mini-portfolio currently includes 5 novel chemical series initially identified in phenotypic screens (extracellular m.tb or m.tb infecting monocytes). the successful elucidation of its mechanism of action has delivered new enzyme targets which are now being screened against gsk corporate compound collection. special attention is dedicated to the discovery of compounds active against m.tb which are not effectively cleared by current anti-tb drugs. a shorter tb regimen is expected to improve patient compliance, increase cure rates and lower toxic side effects, thereby limiting the rise of new resistant strains. a novel tb regimen that is compatible with hiv treatments would improve tb control and help in the fight against aids. in 2012, gsk and tb alliance agreed a 3-year extension of the program. ;

tuberculosis (tb) remains a leading cause of death owing to an infectious disease, claiming around 1.5 million lives each year. standard tb treatment requires six months combination therapy and, for drug-resistant tb, this extends to 18 to 24 months. therefore, there is an urgent need for a shorter, better tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of drug-sensitive tb, as well as a combination therapy that will be more effective in the treatment of drug-resistant tb.; south africa carries a massive tb burden, and this is exacerbated by co-morbidities including hiv and diabetes. in addition, the country is among the top four globally with the highest prevalence of drug-resistant tb disease (tb-in-south africa).; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; h3-d is the first drug discovery centre in africa, with an initial research focus on tb and malaria, two top medical needs on the continent. last year, the first compound developed by h3-d was endorsed by the medicines for malaria venture as a pre-clinical anti-malarial candidate.; through this partnership, novartis supports the centre’s efforts to bridge the gap between basic and clinical studies, training a new generation of african scientists with key skills required for drug discovery and development – integrating medicinal chemistry, disease biology, and pharmacology.; for example, through this collaboration novartis helped h3-d to develop an fda-­level clinical site to conduct phase i clinical studies of new medicines discovered by the centre in cape town, south africa. additionally, novartis supports h3-­d in the design of medicines against tuberculosis (tb), and conduct joint programs on malaria research with the singapore-­based novartis institute for tropical diseases (nitd).as part of the nitd-h3d collaboration, nitd transferred its early tb research projects to h3d (including assays, early discovery compounds, etc.) along with expertise and knowledge (through a comprehensive workshop with nitd scientists at h3d).; in a major development in 2013, h3d was awarded funding by the bill and melinda gates foundation (bmgf) for malaria and tb drug discovery and, subsequently, was elected to the tuberculosis drug accelerator (tbda). within the context of the tbda, further collaborations were initiated with the infectious disease research institute (idri) and elli lilly, as well as celgene global health. h3d also partners with the hit-tb consortium, taking advantage of powerful collaborations with nih research groupings as well as leading public and private institutions in exploring advanced research models to identify new medicines to treat tb.;

if achieved, this would address a quarter of the who’s hypertension target in africa. healthy heart africa aims to do this by determining the most effective methods of integrating hypertension care into existing health platforms.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS ; hypertension, or high blood pressure, is an often-overlooked non-communicable disease that puts patients at high risk of developing more serious cardiovascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. africa has the highest prevalence of adults with hypertension at 46%, and a quarter of all premature deaths in africa are attributable to the condition. hypertension causes 7.5 million deaths annually (12.8% of all deaths) and the risk of dying from hypertension in low and middle-income countries is more than double that in high-income countries. hypertension is a major risk factor for cvd and indicates an increased risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke and other complications. in africa alone, cvd accounts for one in ten deaths across the continent.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; healthy heart africa is designed in consultation and collaboration with non-governmental and community based organizations, international organizations, health experts and governments to support local health systems by increasing awareness of the symptoms and risks of hypertension and by offering education, screening, treatment and control.; the program has three components:; given the novel nature of hha, and the reality that few cost-effective models for ncd care have been proven and scaled in africa, astrazeneca launched five different demonstration projects– hha tested different models across a relatively fragmented healthcare system in order to identify what works and at what cost to inform future scale-up both within kenya and across the region more broadly. hha implementing partners have included ampath, amref, christian health association of kenya (chak), population services kenya (psk), jhpiego, and kenya conference of catholic bishops (kccb). astrazeneca also collaborates with kenya’s mission for essential drugs and supplies (meds), to establish secure supply chains for antihypertensive medicines, and with abt associates, to evaluate baseline and endline program data.; the partner program models have explored a number of approaches for improving access to hypertension care, including:; this has generated key learnings, described in additional detail below, that have supported the expansion of hha programming, both in kenya and ethiopia.; after 18 months in kenya, healthy heart africa has already: ; in september 2016, astrazeneca and pepfar (the u.s. president’s emergency plan for aids relief) launched a partnership to expand access to hiv and hypertension services across africa. the partnership will receive $10 million in funds for a five-year global public-private partnership. it will expand access to hiv/aids and hypertension services by offering them in an integrated manner at existing pepfar-supported hiv/aids sites, beginning in kenya. the new partnership supports the achievement of the un sustainable development goal 3 on good health and well-being. ; it is optimizing existing hiv/aids service delivery infrastructure and more specifically enhancing services for men aged 25-50. data show that men often access hiv/aids testing and treatment at far lower rates than women. for example, according to the most recent kenya aids indicator survey, 79.8 percent of women surveyed had received an hiv test, whereas only 62.5 percent of men had received one. this significant gender disparity leads to hiv-infected men entering care with more advanced disease, being less likely to receive lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (art), and having higher mortality than hiv-infected women. late diagnosis also results in missed opportunities for hiv prevention, including early art initiation, resulting in ongoing transmission to previously uninfected partners.; launching in october 2016 with a one-year pilot program in western kenya, the partnership, in collaboration with the kenyan ministry of health, will leverage pepfar’s existing hiv/aids infrastructure in homa bay and kisumu. these areas were identified not only due to the high burden for all patients, but particularly working-age males who have not yet been reached by current hiv/aids programming. longer term, the partnership aims to extend to other areas where the burdens of both hiv/aids and hypertension are particularly high.; after the success of the hha program in kenya, astrazeneca developed a partnership with the federal ministry of health in ethiopia to integrate hha programming into the ethiopian healthcare system in support of the government of ethiopia’s national strategic action plan for non-communicable diseases. the hha partnership in ethiopia is designed to provide the same programmatic elements that have been successful in kenya while ensuring their appropriate adoption to meet the needs of the ethiopian healthcare system by utilizing the government’s extensive health extension program to bring care closer to the community.; the goal for ethiopia hha partnership is to decentralize and scale up high-quality hypertension care and treatment across health facilities in and around addis ababa, with eventual expansion to twelve hospitals and thirty-six health centres across seven regions. program implementation is being adapted in partnership with the ethiopian ministry of health for integration into public facilities.;

(known as msd outside of the united states and canada) created the msd welcome trust hilleman laboratories, a research and development joint venture with a not-for-profit mission committed to developing high impact, affordable vaccines for people in developing countries in an innovative and sustainable manner.; the partners have strengths that are complementary in many ways. the wellcome trust brings exceptional public health expertise, in-depth policy understanding and experience in biomedical research to the partnership. msd brings expertise in vaccine development and experience in working with a diverse range of stakeholders including international organizations, governments, nongovernmental organizations and philanthropic organizations.; the hilleman laboratories is based in india and is focused on bringing in innovation to act as a catalyst in bridging the gap between academia and product development, leveraging a cadre of talented scientists from around the globe. their expertise in medical research is targeted towards creating new vaccines in areas of unmet needs as well as adapting existing vaccines for more effective delivery in low income countries.; numerous barriers hamper access to live-saving vaccines for millions of people living in the developing world. first, the lack of commercial return has limited private sector investment in new solutions for diseases that predominantly affect low income countries. secondly, many licensed vaccines available in the market today were developed and manufactured with industrialized world citizens in mind.; hilleman laboratories aims to create a novel immunization platform by employing modern technologies focusing on:; over the long-term, hilleman laboratories seeks to collaborate, exchange ideas and build a meaningful dialogue and advocacy platform for vaccine discovery to ultimately strengthen public health systems and immunization programs in developing countries.; summary of impact and forward looking information; beginning in mid-2012, a new management team was put in place at hilleman laboratories (hl) led by industry veterans, dr. davinder gill as ceo and gerd zettlmeissl as chairman of the board of directors.  hl has sharpened its focus on translational research to advance development of vaccines against enteric diseases that disproportionately impact people living in developing countries in asia and africa. ; consistent with this strategy, current research at hl is aimed at a major, unmet need for low income countries, namely developing a more thermostable, affordable rotavirus vaccine. using innovative lyophilization and spray drying technologies, hl has made significant progress in developing new formulations of an optimized rotavirus vaccine with highly thermostable profiles that can better withstand the harsh conditions in developing countries. it will allow for greater temperature consistency and less reliance on exact storage timing and refrigeration.; in addition, the hilleman laboratories has also advanced partnership efforts to advance novel vaccine candidates for cholera and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) mediated infection, leading causes of diarrheal disease in impoverished settings. hl in collaboration with gotovax ab aims to deliver a high impact oral cholera vaccine at a significantly more affordable price than the ones currently available in the market. easy to administer, with cross protection against etec diarrhea and enhanced with a longer shelf life, this vaccine candidate will be most suited for geographies with the highest cholera burden like africa and south asia.; finally, the labs are exploring creative, low cost solutions for delivery and packaging, to simplify vaccine administration in the field.  to guide development, hl continues to obtain external input from the global health community through routine consultation with its strategic advisory group and other stakeholders.;

"180","Humanitarian Product Donations","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; bring high-quality medicines to people who have unmet healthcare needs, oftentimes in challenging situations such as a major natural disaster, conflict or in remote areas.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; in times of disasters and emergencies there is an imperative to respond quickly to ensure lives are saved and protected from disease outbreaks that often follow.; gsk partners with humanitarian aid partners, experienced in the distribution of medicines, who follow who guidelines for medicines donations, ensuring that medicine donations are appropriate to the needs and of maximum benefit to the recipients.; gsk is one of the pharmaceutical industry’s major donors of medical products supporting disaster relief efforts and long-term healthcare programs.; the humanitarian product donation program is a fundamental part of gsk’s community investment activities to help save lives and improve the quality of life of people living in vulnerable situations, whether caused by a sudden unexpected emergency such as a disaster, or as a result of a chronic lack of available medicines for which longer-term, ongoing humanitarian aid is needed and where gsk’s medicines can really make a significant difference.; humanitarian product donations underpin gsk’s global mission to improve the quality of human life by enabling people to do more, feel better and live longer.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; gsk’s approach to medicine donations is unique.  the company works with carefully selected charity partners – americares, project hope, direct relief, ima (interchurch medical assistance) and map international - who are experts in the distribution of medicines.  they are able to select from gsk inventory which means that they have access to long dated, high quality products which meet the needs of communities.  their experience of community healthcare ensures that the right medicines reach people in need at the right time and because the products are pre-positioned in the partners’ warehouses, held in storage, they are able to respond swiftly, often within days of  a disaster occurring.; the partners also draw upon their stock of medicines in their warehouses to support longer-term healthcare programs in areas where medicines are either unavailable or there are gaps in healthcare provision.; gsk’s partners also support programs targeting specific therapy areas, such as direct relief, providing hospitals in east africa with donations of gsk’s anti-emetic medicines, which support patients undergoing cancer treatment which would otherwise be unavailable.; through map international and their medical mission program, gsk’s medicines reach a high number of small, remote communities. each medical mission pack, which physicians in the us can apply for to take with them on their overseas medical mission trips, contains antibiotics and other essential medicines donated by gsk.  ; since 2012 gsk has been working with partners, including save the children, red cross and americares, direct relief and unhcr, to provide cash and product donations, supporting displaced children and families in affected countries.; working across three country phases: `countries of origin', `countries of transition' and `countries of destination', gsk is taking a strategic, longer term approach to address the needs of refugee communities.; to date gsk has contributed over us$ 5m, supporting the following countries: croatia, gaza, greece, italy, jordan, lebanon, malta, spain, syria, serbia, somalia; local businesses also supported with local donations of hygiene and essential items in austria and germany.; funding is being used to provide; in addition, in times of emergencies, gsk also make grants (cash donations) in response to funding appeals received from major aid agencies such as the red cross/red crescent societies or save the children.  the funds can be quickly put to use in disaster situations to mobilise essential emergency supplies in the immediate short-term, supporting local government or other emergency response activities.; gsk’s contribution to humanitarian relief goes beyond these medicine and cash donations to our partners.  gsk volunteers regularly play their part in assisting partners, offering their expertise on 3-6 month secondment ‘pulse’ placements -  helping to improve the delivery of healthcare and access to medicines in the countries where the partners operate.   and, in times of disasters, increasing numbers of gsk employees offer their medical expertise to assist in the delivery of local medicine donations and gifts-in-kind, as well as to raise funds which help to speed up and augment local recovery efforts.; lessons learned                            ; trusted partnerships are key to the humanitarian product donation program’s success.  gsk has been working with the five partners over  a long period of time, in the case of project hope, for example, stretching back over 50 years.; robust governance structures are needed to ensure medicine donations reach the right people at the right time and provide maximum benefit. gsk’s program is managed centrally by the global health programs community partnerships function that facilitates the relationship between gsk and the carefully selected charity partners. these undergo rigorous due diligence and annual legal agreements are put in place to manage gsk’s product donations.; tracking donations to their intended destination is a key part of the contract with non-profit partners. gsk country managers and the community partnerships team have participated in field visits, talking to doctors and patients to be assured that gsk products are being dispensed appropriately and improving people’s health.; gsk’s has also endorsed an internal global humanitarian product donation policy to reinforce the company’s commitment to a strategic and integrated approach of supplying products for humanitarian needs. this also clarifies that gsk does not donate medicines for chronic diseases, where a continuous supply of product is required – instead a sustainable policy of preferential pricing has been implemented for the least developed countries.; a key principle of the donations policy is that country managers approve donations before they are delivered to their markets.  this ensures that medicines are appropriate to the needs of the country and avoids potential conflict with commercial business.  further, gsk managers play an active role in creating strong partnerships at a local level with charities and healthcare workers who distribute and dispense gsk medicines.; gsk’s senior managers recognise that the pharmaceutical industry has a unique and clear purpose in responding to humanitarian needs.  when major disasters occur, such as those in the philippines, the community partnerships team in partnership with the heads of the affected country/region, helps to convene a ‘crisis committee’ that brings together relevant functions such as senior managers of manufacturing, commercial, human resources and corporate communications to ensure a rapid and coordinated response.  gsk can make a tangible difference and stakeholders such as employees and governments recognise this.; gsk and its partners are members of the partnership for quality medical donations (pqmd), an alliance of pharmaceutical companies and non-government organisations who work together to promote best practice in medicine donations and community healthcare. close coordination of the members, especially during disasters, ensures high visibility of each other’s work and mitigates duplication of effort.; summary of impact and forward looking information; in 2016 gsk provided medicines and vaccines valued at £2.5m (cost of goods) for humanitarian purposes to 87 of the world’s poorest countries. it is an area where gsk can make a significant impact because they manufacture products that save lives threatened by infections or injuries.; gsk employees are enormously proud of what the company does for humanitarian relief.; gsk country managers and the community partnerships team have participated in field visits, talking to partners, doctors and patients to be assured that gsk products are being dispensed appropriately and improving people’s health.  they witness first-hand the poor conditions of geographically remote health centres, where there is often no running water and limited medical equipment.  they recognise that it is a ‘win-win’ if medicines can be donated for the most impoverished people who would not otherwise be treated. they appreciate that gsk can intervene in a practical way with additional supplies of essential medicines that save people’s lives and that this can be reflected in the recognition they receive from governments, physicians and healthcare providers.  ;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; in july 2011, msd and the reproductive health supplies coalition (rhsc) announced a partnership to enhance access and appropriate and effective use of the company’s long-acting reversible contraceptive implant implanon® (68 mg etonogestrel implant) for qualified buyers in developing countries. under the initiative, implanon was available at msd’s lowest access price to donor agencies and family planning members of rhsc in sub-saharan africa, and in all other low income countries as defined by the world bank and lower middle income countries with maternal mortality ratios of >200 according to un data.; less than one year later, in november 2012, rhsc announced that the initiative had met its initial target of supplying 4.5 million units of the product, triggering a further credit rebate for the eligible recipient countries.; in may 2013, building on the company’s previous price announcement, msd and a group of public- and private-sector partners announced an agreement to further expand contraceptive access and options for millions of women in some of the world’s poorest countries. the increased volume generated from the success of the initial initiative with rhsc and the guarantee of continued volume has allowed msd to achieve improved economies of scale making the further price reduction possible.; under the agreement, msd will reduce the cost of implanon and its next-generation implant, implanon nxt® (68 mg etonogestrel implant), radiopaque, by approximately 50 percent for the next six years in the targeted poorest eligible countries of focus for the reproductive health community. these countries are those with a 2010 per capita gross national income less than or equal to us$2,500 per year based on the world bank classification using the atlas method. they are thought least likely to meet the millennium development goals set by the un general assembly in 1990 to reduce the number of infant and young child deaths by two-thirds and to improve maternal health by 2015. collectively they are referred to as the fp2020 countries.; in the countries where msd products are included in family planning programs, they work closely with ministries of health and local implementing partners, who play a pivotal role in supporting training, counseling and other related activities. local implementing partners have included jhpiego, engenderhealth, marie stopes international, international planned parenthood federation, population services international, pathfinder international and dkt. such collaboration ensures that countries have the expertise and support they need to achieve their reproductive health objectives.;

under the agreement, msd will reduce the cost of implanon and its next-generation implant, implanon nxt® (68 mg etonogestrel implant), radiopaque, by approximately 50 percent for the next six years in the targeted poorest eligible countries of focus for the reproductive health community. these countries are those with a 2010 per capita gross national income less than or equal to us$2,500 per year based on the world bank classification using the atlas method. they are thought least likely to meet the millennium development goals set by the un general assembly in 1990 to reduce the number of infant and young child deaths by two-thirds and to improve maternal health by 2015. collectively they are referred to as the fp2020 countries.; in the countries where msd products are included in family planning programs, they work closely with ministries of health and local implementing partners, who play a pivotal role in supporting training, counseling and other related activities. local implementing partners have included jhpiego, engenderhealth, marie stopes international, international planned parenthood federation, population services international, pathfinder international and dkt. such collaboration ensures that countries have the expertise and support they need to achieve their reproductive health objectives.; lessons learned; summary of impact and forward looking information; in 2013, more than 4 million women had access to implanon/nxt in fp2020 program through the implanon access initiative. msd worked with more than 35 countries in sub-saharan africa, asia and central america to provide implanon and implanon nxt through numerous partnerships with governments, donors and non-government organizations.; moving forward, msd continues to work with stakeholders to address barriers beyond price, including regulatory approvals, logistics and supply chain management, health provider training, and awareness creation and demand generation efforts.;

the project was conducted in shimla and solan districts of himachal pradesh, a hilly terrain in northern india. ; around 90 per cent of the people residing in the hilly and difficult terrains of himachal pradesh do not have access to health services. average distance travelled by one health worker per day also varies from 15 meters to 2 kms in inaccessible and accessible areas. energy spent per day to perform house visit is also comparatively more in hilly terrain as compared to plain areas. ; the hilly terrain creates challenge for the rural population to access the health care services and therefore people need to be given health information that comes handy and easy to understand. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges ; the project aimed at generating awareness on diabetes through a mobile app. self management of conditions and awareness on diabetes through a mobile app plays a key role. given the reach of mobile networks and connected services, mhealth solutions can play a vital role in primary prevention of diabetes and continuous monitoring of disease trends. ; diab info is a need based mobile app developed for the community utilizes text and video content to provide information and promote diabetes self-management skills without complex navigation. it helps to create a daily track of their own health records like blood glucose level, medicines, physical activity etc. behavioural indicators for diabetes were also a part of the app such as diet patterns, quitting alcohol and tobacco. ; activities done in the community to introduce the mobile health app, its visibility and use ; the beneficiaries after downloading and installing the app could view their status and learn on diabetes. ; summary of impact and forward looking information ; a cross-sectional quantitative household survey was undertaken among 834 men and women of 10-44 years age group. 48.4 % found the app is useful in behaviour change like daily physical activities and 53.6% found the app useful in controlling the diet. in the case of early detection and symptoms of diabetes, more than 56% respondents replied that the application will benefit the user. ; 52.4% have found the app useful in understanding the preventive measures of diabetes and 49.5% found it easy to tell if they are at risk for diabetes. about 45% of individuals have found that the application makes the individual easy to understand about management of the disease. ;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; in 2004, pfizer, accordia global health foundation, makerere university, the infectious diseases society of america, the pangaea global aids foundation and other organizations partnered to establish the infectious diseases institute (idi) within the makerere university of uganda to improve health in africa by training medical professionals and providing them with skills and resources to use in their communities. the idi built its research capacity in africa by pairing promising new investigators with established researchers from north america and europe, and through mentoring arrangements and fellowships.; by enhancing the stature and recognition of the faculty of medicine at makerere university, pfizer's support of the idi helped to reverse the trend of african healthcare professionals pursuing career opportunities abroad. african doctors, medical scientists, and other healthcare professionals can now pursue their clinical interests in a world-class academic medical setting and serve their home countries and people.; the partnership has had an important contribution in supporting the establishment of different idi clinics to tackle existing or emerging, but unaddressed health issues affecting the ugandan society.; an integrated hiv/tb clinic was formed in late 2009. in the first year alone, more than 2,500 patients were screened for tb and approximately 240 patients have been diagnosed with tb and started on treatment.;

based on studies in uganda showing a shift in the way hiv is spread, a discordant couple’s clinic was also established to provide specialized clinical care using positive prevention techniques (prevention efforts directed towards individuals living with hiv), peer support meetings, and iec materials.; lessons learned; through the diversification of idi’s clinics, there are several lessons learned as well as opportunity to continue to research to improve on these specialized services.; a tb working group was formed to focus on improving tb/hiv care for patients at idi, standardize tb prevention, diagnosis and follow-up procedures, and increase involvement of medical officers in tb management. there are many opportunities for research, specialized training in tb/hiv co-infection and collaborative activities in this field.; adolescents and young adults infected with hiv face many challenges. one of the most significant is frequent lack of financial stability—since the majority of them have dropped out of school and need support to secure their financial independence. the transition clinic is a new model of care that has dramatically changed the lives of a number of young adults. the institute is exploring the potential for increasing the capacity of this specialised clinic and exporting this model of care to other service providers within uganda. efforts are being made to support the skill and entrepreneurial development among hiv-positive youth, which will go a long way in improving the welfare of these young people.;

2) strengthening the health system; and 3) improving key household and community practices that have the greatest impact on child survival.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; ethiopiathe health status of ethiopians (population approximately 65 million) is among the lowest in the world with health service coverage at 50.4%. the ministry of health of the federal democratic republic of ethiopia endorsed imci as the main strategy to reduce the unacceptably high under five mortality - 140 per 1000 live births (fmoh, 2002/2003 dabat and wukro districts were selected from amhara and tigray regions respectively for piloting c-imci implementation in the country. based on the encouraging results from the two pilot districts in amhara and tigray regions, further expansion has taken place to benishangul-gumuz and oromiya regions.ghanawho, ghana health service and gsk signed a tri-partite agreement to improve the care and management of children less than five years of age at community levels (thereby improving under-five morbidity and mortality in the long term) in 12 districts. specific objectives: to improve the knowledge and practices of families and communities;

"210","International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI)","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; more than 36 million people have died due to aids-related causes since the pandemic began and millions more are newly infected with the virus each year. global efforts to battle the pandemic are making a significant difference; still, aids remains the sixth leading cause of death in low-income countries, according to the world health organization. the most vulnerable and impoverished people in the world continue to bear the heaviest burden of this merciless disease: sub-saharan africa accounted for 70% of new hiv infections in 2012.; the best long-term solution to the growing global aids epidemic is a vaccine, which does not yet exist.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the international aids vaccine initiative (iavi) was created in 1996 out of recognition that the best long-term solution to the growing aids epidemic was a vaccine. as a global organization operating across borders to meet the challenges posed by the epidemic, iavi works to ensure the development of safe, effective, accessible and preventive hiv vaccines for use throughout the world. iavi's work focuses on four areas:; the international aids vaccine initiative (iavi) works with its partners to ensure the development of safe, effective, accessible and preventive hiv vaccines for use throughout the world.; iavi‘s scientific team works with more than 50 academic, commercial and government institutions to develop and assess candidate hiv vaccines. iavi has partnered with local research institutions to develop a network of sophisticated laboratories in india and in southern and eastern africa. iavi also has brought leading hiv researchers together into scientific consortia, including the neutralizing antibody consortium and the vectors consortium, to address key obstacles to the development of an effective aids vaccine and to generate novel candidates.; uniquely positioned to rapidly move novel vaccine candidates from the academic bench to clinical testing in the developing world, iavi’s success comes in part from an end-to-end network of 10 collaborating clinical research centers in africa, in-house research laboratories and external academic, government and industry collaborators. in developing countries, iavi works closely with governmental, community and civic organizations to ensure the transparent and ethical conduct of clinical trials. iavi helps educate people about vaccine trials and the need for aids vaccines and also helps build both the clinical and scientific capacity required to run a long-term program of vaccine trials.; iavi also analyzes and develops policies to promote the involvement of the private sector in aids vaccine research and development, advocating for policies that will ensure that once an aids vaccine is developed, it will be swiftly produced, distributed and made affordable worldwide.iavi conducts leading-edge vaccine science with top laboratories around the world and harnesses innovation from within and beyond the hiv vaccine field to introduce new tools, technologies and concepts to change the arc of aids vaccine science.; in 2005, glaxosmithkline launched the first formal public-private partnership with iavi to research vaccines against hiv strains that circulate predominantly in africa. iavi and gsk contributed technical, preclinical and clinical expertise and shared funding; researchers from both groups formed a joint project team. they evaluated the combination of two vaccine candidates (the f4/as01 adjuvanted protein developed by gsk and the adenovirus 35-grin vaccine developed by iavi) up to phase i clinical trial in which long term follow-up is currently ongoing. ; janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson and  iavi entered into an agreement to develop an hiv vaccine based on the company's advac adenovirus vector technology and obtained the rights from j&j to use a cell line for these vectors. a phase i clinical trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine based on this technology started in 2009.; in august 2010 janssen and iavi announced their participation in an international phase i clinical trial in the united states and africa of a combination of two ad-based aids vaccine candidates, ad26.enva.01 and ad35-env, in healthy adults who are not infected with hiv. the clinical trial, led by iavi has started in october 2010, representing a collaboration between iavi, janssen, the ragon institute, and beth israel deaconess medical center (bidmc), a major teaching hospital of harvard medical school.; lessons learned              ; perhaps the most critical roadblock to the development of an effective aids vaccine arises from hiv’s uncanny ability to avoid neutralization by antibodies. however, a handful of antibodies capable of shutting down the many variants of the virus have been isolated from hiv-infected individuals.; work done within iavi’s neutralizing antibody consortium (nac) has since exposed not only how each of the known neutralizing antibodies manages to shut down hiv, but also how the virus shields its vulnerable spots from immune attack. this information is now being harnessed by nac scientists to devise new approaches to developing aids vaccine candidates.; summary of impact and forward looking information; researchers and policymakers are today increasingly convinced that an aids vaccine is possible and could help significantly slow the spread of hiv. scientists have isolated and closely analyzed dozens of exceptionally potent antibodies that neutralize a broad spectrum of hiv variants circulating around the world.;

work done within iavi’s neutralizing antibody consortium (nac) has since exposed not only how each of the known neutralizing antibodies manages to shut down hiv, but also how the virus shields its vulnerable spots from immune attack. this information is now being harnessed by nac scientists to devise new approaches to developing aids vaccine candidates.; summary of impact and forward looking information; researchers and policymakers are today increasingly convinced that an aids vaccine is possible and could help significantly slow the spread of hiv. scientists have isolated and closely analyzed dozens of exceptionally potent antibodies that neutralize a broad spectrum of hiv variants circulating around the world.; to date, some 30 aids vaccine clinical trials are ongoing, predominantly in early stages (phases i and ii).;","bristol-myers squibb; glaxosmithkline; johnson & johnson;","basque autonomous government;

"211","International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM)","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; hiv/aids is one of the world’s most serious and immediate threats to women’s health and has claimed more than 36 million lives worldwide. according to the world health organization (who), since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 75 million people have been infected with the hiv virus and about 36 million people have died of hiv. globally, 35.3 million [32.2–38.8 million] people were living with hiv at the end of 2012. an estimated 0.8% of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with hiv, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. sub-saharan africa remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 20 adults living with hiv and accounting for 71% of the people living with hiv worldwide.; vaginal microbicides are topical products being developed to prevent heterosexual transmission of hiv. microbicides could take many forms, including those that could be used monthly or daily, or at or around the time of intercourse.; researchers at the international partnership for microbicides (ipm) are developing a variety of products that include daily vaginal gels, films and tablets, as well as vaginal rings that would release an arv drug gradually and provide protection against hiv for as much as a month at a time.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; ipm provides women with affordable and self-initiated hiv-prevention strategies to reduce hiv transmission and is developing microbicides based on existing antiretroviral (arv) drugs being used to successfully treat hiv/aids and prevent mother-to-child transmission.; ipm receives non-royalty-bearing, non-exclusive licenses from companies to develop, manufacture and distribute novel arv compounds for use as a vaginal microbicides in developing countries to help protect women from hiv. some of the compounds, such as members of a class of arv molecules known as fusion inhibitors, inhibit hiv infection by preventing the virus from fusing with the surface of target cells, which is an early step in the hiv infection process. these compounds may offer a novel way of blocking infections.; ipm focuses on preventing hiv transmission by accelerating the development and availability of safe and effective microbicides and other hiv prevention methods for use by women in developing countries.; janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson, established one of the very first public-private partnerships in the microbicides field with ipm in 2004, providing royalty-free licensing and technology transfer to develop, manufacture and commercialize dapivirine (tmc120) as a vaginal microbicide to reduce sexual transmission of hiv in resource-poor countries. in 2014, janssen expanded this collaboration, granting ipm exclusive worldwide rights for dapivirine alone or in combination with either microbicidal antiretroviral medicines and/or in combination with contraceptives.  ipm’s monthly vaginal microbicidal ring with dapivirine – potentially the first product of its kind – is now being studied in two parallel efficacy trials in multiple african countries with results expected in late 2015. ipm is also developing a 90-day ring that combines dapivirine with a contraceptive, which is set to enter clinical testing in 2015.; in october 2005, bristol-myers squibb announced that it had granted a royalty-free license to ipm to develop, manufacture and distribute two new antiretroviral compounds as vaginal microbicides to protect women from hiv in resource poor countries. the compounds are hiv attachment inhibitors which bind directly to the hiv itself and prevent the virus attachment to the host cell receptor. the compounds are designed to prevent hiv from entering host cells, thus preventing infection.; msd granted  ipm a non-royalty-bearing, nonexclusive license to develop, manufacture and distribute a novel arv compound for use as a vaginal microbicide to help protect women in developing countries. the compound, the fourth we have licensed to ipm, is a member of a class of arv molecules known as fusion inhibitors, which inhibit hiv infection by preventing the virus from fusing with the surface of the target cells – an early step in the hiv process – potentially representing a novel way to block infection. merck is also collaborating with division of aids (daids) clinical research policies and standard procedures documents to advance early-stage product development research efforts. ; ipm works with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, philanthropic foundations, local research centers in developing countries, civil society organizations and academic institutions to evaluate promising compounds, design optimal formulations, conduct preclinical and clinical trials, identify appropriate regulatory pathways for products and establish manufacturing and distribution capacity to ensure access to future products.; lessons learned; the promise that microbicides represent will be realized only if women can obtain these products easily and affordably, and will use them effectively once they are available.; ensuring access to drugs in developing countries can be highly challenging because of weak health systems and a lack of skilled health workers and financing. new drugs have historically been designed and developed for industrialized markets, and introduced into developing countries only several years later, if at all.; summary of impact and forward looking information; findings from the first clinical trial of an arv-based microbicide announced in july 2010 offer new cause for optimism. the trial, called caprisa 004, demonstrated proof-of-concept that an arv-based microbicide can prevent women from becoming infected with hiv through sex with an infected male partner. conducted in south africa among 889 women, the caprisa trial found a 39 percent lower hiv infection rate in women using 1% tenofovir gel as compared to those women using a placebo gel. dozens of potential drugs that interrupt hiv transmission or replication are currently being studied as possible microbicide candidates. ;

after a drug receives regulatory approval, ongoing clinical research continues to provide invaluable insights on the most effective use of new medicines. janssen supports or conducts clinical research on the appropriate and safe use of our approved hiv medicines in rls. janssen is currently supporting the switching at low hiv-1 rna into fixed dose combinations (salif) study, which will help further determine the appropriate clinical positioning of rilpivirine in rls. patients with higher viral loads (vl >100,000 copies/ml) are less likely to achieve viral suppression with rilpivirine, which is a concern in rls where viral load testing, especially prior to treatment initiation, is not often available. salif will explore rilpivirine as a potential “switch” option once a viral load of <50 copies/ml is reached. this study is an important first step in efforts to ensure the safe and appropriate use of rilpivirine in resource-limited settings. salif is a multicenter, multi-country, open-label study that will take place at 28 sites in six countries in sub-saharan africa (ghana, uganda, kenya, senegal, cameroon, and south africa) and two countries in asia-pacific (thailand and vietnam). patient recruitment is underway.;

"218","Johnson & Johnson Ebola Vaccine Development","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; to accelerate the development of investigational “prime-boost” vaccine regimens to protect against filoviruses including the ebola virus, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the world is prepared for future outbreaks. ; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; the 2014-2016 ebola outbreak in west africa was the biggest filovirus outbreak the world has ever seen. more than 28,600 individuals were infected with the virus across guinea, sierra leone and liberia and more than 11,300 people died – including more than 500 healthcare workers. experts agree that future outbreaks are highly likely. additionally, the documented persistence of the virus in ebola survivors adds to the urgency of finding a robust and durable vaccine that produces sustained immunity. vaccine regimens in development could be vital prevention tools for outbreak response and preparedness, particularly for health workers and other vulnerable populations on the frontlines.; no licensed vaccine to prevent ebola virus disease currently exists.  ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; since 2014, johnson & johnson has mobilized significant resources to accelerate the development of heterologous prime-boost ebola vaccine regimens, including monovalent and multivalent regimens. heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens aim to create longer-lasting immunity through the administration of multiple vaccine doses of different kinds over time.; the monovalent program, designed to address the ebola virus, features a prime-boost vaccine regimen of two vaccine components that are based on advac® technology from janssen vaccines & prevention b.v., part of the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson, and mva-bn® technology from bavarian nordic. janssen launched 10 phase 1, 2 and 3 studies in rapid succession across three continents to evaluate this vaccine regimen, and secured funding from leading sponsors of research in europe (the innovative medicines initiative) and the us (the national institutes of health, and the biomedical advanced research and development authority) to support this program.; johnson & johnson is also developing a second-generation, multivalent version of the advac/mva-bn vaccine regimen. the multivalent prime-boost regimen is intended to protect against multiple filoviruses that cause disease in humans, including the ebola, sudan and marburg viruses.; janssen’s investigational ebola vaccine regimens originate from a collaborative research program with the us national institutes of health that began in 2008.; lessons learned; to be fully prepared for the next major ebola outbreak, the world will likely need several ebola vaccines. different vaccines may offer different advantages. for example, some may be optimized for rapid administration during an emerging outbreak and others for long-term prevention and protection of vulnerable populations such as health workers. additionally, it will be important to have more than one proven and approved vaccine available to ensure uninterrupted supply and overcome potential manufacturing constraints associated with a specific product.; many challenges face the successful development and deployment of an ebola vaccine, especially in resource-limited countries. johnson & johnson is collaborating with partners to promote awareness, understanding and uptake of new ebola vaccines in clinical trial settings through communications and community engagement strategies.; summary of impact and forward looking information; final phase 1 results from a uk study of the investigational monovalent vaccine regimen were published in march 2017 in jama: the journal of the american medical association. the study in healthy volunteers found that the regimen was well-tolerated, and produced an immune response among 100 percent of participants that was sustained 1 year following vaccination. preliminary data from phase 1 trials in africa also suggest that the vaccine regimen elicits a persistent immune response.; in partnership with bavarian nordic, janssen has rapidly scaled up production of the vaccine regimen and currently has approximately 1,800,000 regimens available, with the capacity to produce several million regimens if needed.; in september 2016, johnson & johnson completed a submission to the world health organization (who) for emergency use assessment and listing (eual) for the monovalent prime-boost vaccine regimen. the eual is a special procedure that can be implemented where there is an outbreak of a disease with high rates of morbidity or mortality and a lack of approved treatment or prevention options. if the who grants eual, this will accelerate the availability of janssen’s investigational vaccine regimen to the international community in the event another ebola crisis occurs.;

in 2013 the novartis foundation launched a new leprosy strategy that focuses on interrupting transmission, to support the last mile in the ultimate goal of leprosy elimination. this strategy is based on consensus reached by a group of leading leprosy and disease elimination experts, who agree that a successful program requires early diagnosis and prompt treatment for all patients, tracing (also known as active screening) and post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) for contact persons of patients newly diagnosed with leprosy, development of new diagnostic tools, as well as strict epidemiological surveillance and response systems to monitor progress. the aim of this strategy is to demonstrate that the annual number of newly diagnosed leprosy patients can be further reduced.; to implement this strategy, in june 2014, the novartis foundation collaborated with several international federation of anti-leprosy associations (ilep) members: netherlands leprosy relief, fairmed, american leprosy missions and the german leprosy and tb relief association , along with swiss tph and erasmus university in the netherlands and national leprosy control programs to introduce pep in several pilot countries across asia, africa and latin america with the purpose of reducing the risk to develop leprosy in contact persons of newly diagnosed patients.; the lpep program has been introduced in indonesia, india, nepal, myanmar, tanzania, sri lanka, brazil and cambodia. lpep will run until 2018 for all countries, except cambodia, which is set to finish in 2019. once a new patient has been diagnosed, health services actively screen household members and neighbors of the patient and examine them. symptomatic persons are promptly referred for multidrug therapy (mdt) and asymptomatic contact persons are offered a post-exposure prophylaxis (single dose rifampicin), to reduce their risk of developing leprosy by 50-60%. this active contact tracing of newly diagnosed patients is a targeted strategy to prevent leprosy and to accelerate diagnosis and prompt treatment among those most at risk. ;

"224","Lifestyle Interventions for Prevention, Early Diagnosis and Self-Management of Diabetes in Mumbai City","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS ; diabetes is rapidly emerging as a major health-care problem in india, especially in urban areas. furthermore, there is an equally large pool of people with impaired glucose tolerance (igt), many of whom will go on to develop type 2 diabetes in the future. (a person has impaired glucose tolerance (igt) when their blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal, but below the level of a person with diabetes. most people with igt are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.); india is in the midst of a diabetes epi­demic. diabetes requires life-long treatment and impacts upon people's daily lives. it carries the risk of chronic complications.; these worrying figures of diabetes prevalence in india can only hint at the terrible burden of diabetes carried by adults affected by this condition in india. millions of adults in india are leading their lives or are set to enter life afflicted by chronic and potentially life-threatening complications of diabetes.; given the scenario of diabetes in urban india especially in mumbai city and an impending health care disaster, this project aimed at the following target groups:; working adults in unorganized sector units in mumbai slums:;  the indian economy is characterized by the existence of a vast majority of informal or unorganized labour employment. it accounts for over 68% of labour employment in mumbai (national sample survey organization, 2010). workers engaged in this urban informal sector form the bulk of the urban poor and they work in small and privately owned enterprises such as; leather work, weaving, artisans, saw mills, preparation of food items for wholesale, recycling units, rag pickers, handicraft artisans, handloom weavers etc. the labor laws and policies have minimal control over these types of industries. such enterprises operate vastly in the slum communities of the city and employ the people from the nearby communities and other parts of city of mumbai. these enterprises are characterized by lack of space, poor working conditions with minimal or no facilities for the welfare of the workers and numerous work related health hazards. as a result of irregular and stretched work hours, stress at work, in-sufficient and irregular sleep/ rest hours, irregular food intake, absence of balanced diet due to lack of knowledge as well as lack of resources, lack of easy access to health care services, etc. pose threat of various lifestyle diseases including diabetes among the lives of these workers. ; public health workers:;  in order to ensure widespread awareness and education among the community members about diabetes; it is crucial to integrate and coordinate medical, non-medical as well as policy efforts at the community level. thus, the project engaged integrated child development scheme (icds) under the aegis of women & child development department, government of maharashtra, which has a cadre of health care workers (recruited from the local communities) termed as “anganwadi workers” for providing health education and nutritional services to the community members with special focus on maternal and child care. the icds has a very wide network for providing these health care services in the city of mumbai. given below is the structure of icds scheme in mumbai city.  these volunteers operate largely in the congested slum communities to reach the health care services to the masses including health education, immunization, etc. these workers normally are from the slum communities itself and have in depth knowledge of the community needs and challenges. however; anganwadi wokers are paramedics and have limited knowledge and skills to diagnose, detect and inform the community members on the chronic diseases such as diabetes. hence there is need to train them as diabetes educators who can reach out to the community members who have limited access to formal health care systems. the project also works on providing testing services to the chvs and provide support for self management of diabetes. ; teachers of municipal/ public/ ngo run school:; diabetes is common chronic disease of childhood, affecting infants, toddlers, children and teens. according to the conclusions amassed by the indian chapter of world health organisation, prevalence of type 1 diabetes is 12% in the age group above 10- 20 years india. most of these children go on to develop type 2 diabetes; which is alarming. yet, most people are unaware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes in children, and as a result, the diagnosis is often delayed or missed altogether. children and adolescents spend significant amount of their time in schools and the teachers have great amount of influence on their lives. thus, it is essential that these school teachers are educated with the basic information about the diabetes, its causes, symptoms and the treatment available. with this knowledge, the teachers shall be able to identify the diabetic symptoms among the children at an early stage and counsel the parents for availing medical treatment. the project targets to train the teachers from public i.e. municipal schools, or the schools run by non governmental organizations (ngos) which cater to the children from the underprivileged sections of society. most of the children in these schools belong to economically poor, less educated families with lack of access to quality health services. thus, the trained teachers serve as health educators for early detection and prevention of diabetes among the children thereby creating a more informed next generation. the project also provide testing services to the teachers and provide support for self management of diabetes.  ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges ; project component i: activities for testing, early diagnosis & medical referral stakeholders:; this project component encompasses vital aspects such as sensitization activities, testing, diagnosis, medical referral etc. for diabetes. uwm has carried out outreach activities with all three target groups of the communities i.e. unorganised sector workers,  public health workers and municpal schoolteachers across the city of mumbai.  following project activities were carried out as part of outreach to these stakeholders. ; method for two hours education session on critical aspects of diabetes for the target community members:;  ; based on this methadology following number of stakeholders were reached out for each of the traget groups:; unorganised sector workers; ; public health workers; ; municipal school teachers; ; project component ii: monitoring and follow up of the diabetic patients:; all community memers who report high levels of blood glucose during the testing camps are immediately counselled by uwm by insisting on the need for detailed investigation, importance of a healthy lifestyle and healthy food habits. these persons were also counselled so as to prepare them psychologically to accept the fact that, they are at risk for diabetes. also they are referred to the nearest municipal dispensary where the treatment is available at free of cost. family visits are being conducted to further sensitize and educate the patients as well as their family members for better management of diabetes.; ; regular maintenance of records:; a robust mechanism of patient diagnosis, treatment and follow up has been adopted by uwm in order to ensure efficient outreach. for this following tools and processes have been adopted and followed rigorously for all the project activities.; these are as follows:; ; family management of diabetes; this intervention has proven to be successful for management of diabetic patients through family support and care.  as part of this intervention periodic home visits are undertaken to follow up on treatment compliance and sensitisation of family members for management of diabetic person in the family.  these visits consist of one to one discussions with family members and sensitisation on diet plan for diabetic person in the family, easy and cost effective methods of preparing nutritious meals, psychosocial support the etc. ; summary of impact and forward looking information; icds aanganwadi workers ; ; municipal school teachers ; ; unorganised workers sector;  ; it is pertinent to note that interventions for project target group of unorganised sector workers were undertaken at the workplace itself.  being unorganised sector workplaces, these areas have limited space and challenges of noise, poor visibility due to inadequate lighting etc. hence uwm could accommodate only 15-20 workers for the sessions at a time which meant increased efforts to be put in for each of the awareness session and testing activities. moreover this being workplace interventions, uwm targeted early morning hours or late evenings to undertake these activities. this was done to ensure that the workers do not lose their hourly income during work time and could participate in the awareness session on wholeheartedly. through such simple but effective strategies, uwm could overcome these challenges and have been able to manage the project outreach in the stipulated timeline. ; ; diabetes disease burden: ; based on the analysis of the stakeholders, it was found that the high glucose level was 4% among the icds aanganwadi workers, 6% among the municipal schools teachers and 7% among the unorganised sector workers.  this clearly validates the need for such interventions among these project stakeholders.; while implementing these interventions, uwm realised that there was no or very little awareness of this  disease among these stakeholders. moreover there was clear dearth of public private interventions for advocacy on diabetes among these project stakeholders. hence it is imperative that such interventions are continued with long term engagement. this was a one of its kind of projects where uwm undertook interventions with unorganized sector workers, icds aanganwadi workers and municipal school teachers and could achieve significant impact.  ; especially with the unorganized sector workers, our experiences have been very revealing. through the interventions we could break the myth (largely prevalent in india) that diabetes affects only rich communities who have comfortable lifestyle.  through this project with the unorganized sector workers, we could prove that people from underprivileged societies are just as at risk for diabetes. they work at enterprises which are characterized by lack of space, poor working conditions with minimal or no facilities for the welfare of the workers and numerous work related health hazards. as a result of irregular and stretched work hours, stress at work, in-sufficient and irregular sleep/ rest hours, irregular food intake, absence of balanced diet due to lack of knowledge as well as lack of resources, lack of easy access to health care services, etc. pose threat of various lifestyle diseases including diabetes among the lives of these workers. these workers are generally ignorant about diabetes or the ways to manage it or an understanding that they too are at risk for diabetes.; while implementing these interventions, uwm had a better understanding of the complete lack or very little awareness of this disease among these stakeholders. moreover there is clear dearth of public private interventions for advocacy on diabetes among these project stakeholders, and a necessity to scale up interventions with long term engagement. ;

mmv is funded by foundations, governments and corporations. regarded by who and the roll back malaria partnership as an important partner, it now manages the largest portfolio of malaria medicine research in history, with nearly 40 projects underway at the end of 2008. mmv has mini-portfolio agreements with genzyme, glaxosmithkline, merck, novartis and sanofi. other partners include chong qing holley, msd, shin poong and sigma-tau.; mmv subsidizes 30 scientists at gsk's dedicated ddw research facility in tres cantos. as compounds move into clinical development, gsk provides clinical, regulatory and manufacturing expertise and resources via its global r&d and supply network. in 2008, gsk announced a new collaboration with mmv to identify novel drugs for the treatment of malaria. research will focus on macrolide antibiotics, which may help treat drug-resistant malaria. gsk and mmv are currently developing tafenoquine, a potential new treatment for the radical cure of p vivax malaria).; the novartis institute for tropical diseases is working with mmv to help to prevent, treat and block the spread of malaria by developing new classes of drugs that attack both liver and blood stages. in 2009, novartis and mmv introduced coartem®dispersible, the first artemisinin-based combination (act) formulation developed for children with malaria. the medicine contains the same concentration of active ingredients as the regular tablet, but in a dispersible formulation that is easier to give to babies and children, which helps to ensure that this population receives the correct dose. the sweet-tasting formulation dissolves quickly in small amounts of water which enhances its use in young children. in june 2016, novartis announced the expansion of its partnership with mmv to develop kaf156. novartis will lead the development of this compound with scientific and financial support from mmv in collaboration with the bill & melinda gates foundation. kaf156, currently in phase iib clinical development, belongs to a novel class of antimalarial compounds that act against both the blood and liver stages of the parasite's lifecycle. in september 2016, novartis published proof of concept study results in the new england journal of medicine showing that kaf156 demonstrated activity against both vivax and falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant parasites.; in 2008, mmv signed a mou with sanofi for discovery work, including early-stage molecule testing, and screening, plus clinical development of ferroquine, sar97276 and trioxaquine. starting in 2009, mmv contributed to the dndi and sanofi 'asaq field monitoring program' in côte d'ivoire. with approximately 15,000 patients, this is the largest study ever done on an antimalarial and should help african experts and government bodies to develop innovative pharmacovigilance methods in 'real life' conditions. in 2011 sanofi and mmv announced a three-year agreement to research malaria treatments titled “orthology malaria”.  as part of the agreement, both parties will work together to identify, characterize and optimize new candidate compounds to treat malaria and conduct early development programs to demonstrate proof of concept in men.; in 2009, pfizer and mmv signed an agreement which allowed griffith university in brisbane, australia to screen approximately 200,000 compounds from the pfizer compound library against plasmodium falciparum malaria.  in 2010, pfizer and mmv signed an agreement for a second stage of collaboration to optimize and develop promising compounds to clinical proof of concept based on target product profiles defined by the joint steering committee.; in march 2009, msd and mmv announced a licensing agreement for an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of malaria in the developing world. msd, whose researchers discovered the candidate, granted mmv an exclusive, royalty-free license to pursue the development of this investigational candidate for use in malaria-endemic countries. msd retains the option to become mmv's development partner upon completion of the first phase ii clinical trial of the candidate. also within the agreement, msd has committed not to profit from its sale in malaria-endemic countries.; in april 2013, merck's biopharmaceutical division, merck serono, signed a partnership with mmv. together, mmv and merck work to develop new long lasting anti-malarial compounds through current lead optimization programs, contributing to global efforts to find new therapies to fight re-emergence of drug resistance to currently available malarials. a first program has already been evaluated by the external scientific advisory committee (esac) of mmv and has obtained full support for further development.; in june 2013, with support from the ghit fund, takeda began to work with mmv, in a program to screen takeda’s drug compound library for new candidate compounds that might have the potential to be developed into new drugs for the treatment of malaria.; summary of impact; the collaboration has identified promising leads.; in its search for new molecules against malaria, mmv and partners have so far supported the screening of more than 5 million compounds for their potential activity against the malaria parasite. three partners of the mmv-supported early discovery projects have gone a step further and released the data pertaining to the active molecules into the public domain. this bold move will enable scientists the world over to access these data ensuring their antimalarial potential be used to the full. ; in 2012, 331 million artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) courses were procured by the public and private sectors in endemic countries – up from 278 million in 2011, and just 11 million in 2005. acts are recommended as the first-line treatment for malaria caused by plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly plasmodium species that infects humans. ; the merck and mmv partnership is still in its early phase but has already proven very effective in identifying promising leads, and is the ground of the newly formed malaria & diagnostics team within merck serono. this team will have the task to create a mini-portfolio with the collaboration of mmv to address unmet needs in the currently developed mmv anti-malarial portfolio. ; in 2009, novartis and mmv introduced coartem®dispersible, the first artemisinin-based combination (act) formulation developed for children with malaria. since its launch, more than 300 million coartem®dispersible treatments have been delivered without profit to 40 countries, mainly in africa. this makes it the first pediatric act to have been delivered in such large quantities.;

in april 2013, merck's biopharmaceutical division, merck serono, signed a partnership with mmv. together, mmv and merck work to develop new long lasting anti-malarial compounds through current lead optimization programs, contributing to global efforts to find new therapies to fight re-emergence of drug resistance to currently available malarials. a first program has already been evaluated by the external scientific advisory committee (esac) of mmv and has obtained full support for further development.; in june 2013, with support from the ghit fund, takeda began to work with mmv, in a program to screen takeda’s drug compound library for new candidate compounds that might have the potential to be developed into new drugs for the treatment of malaria.; summary of impact; the collaboration has identified promising leads.; in its search for new molecules against malaria, mmv and partners have so far supported the screening of more than 5 million compounds for their potential activity against the malaria parasite. three partners of the mmv-supported early discovery projects have gone a step further and released the data pertaining to the active molecules into the public domain. this bold move will enable scientists the world over to access these data ensuring their antimalarial potential be used to the full. ; in 2012, 331 million artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) courses were procured by the public and private sectors in endemic countries – up from 278 million in 2011, and just 11 million in 2005. acts are recommended as the first-line treatment for malaria caused by plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly plasmodium species that infects humans. ; the merck and mmv partnership is still in its early phase but has already proven very effective in identifying promising leads, and is the ground of the newly formed malaria & diagnostics team within merck serono. this team will have the task to create a mini-portfolio with the collaboration of mmv to address unmet needs in the currently developed mmv anti-malarial portfolio. ; in 2009, novartis and mmv introduced coartem®dispersible, the first artemisinin-based combination (act) formulation developed for children with malaria. since its launch, more than 300 million coartem®dispersible treatments have been delivered without profit to 40 countries, mainly in africa. this makes it the first pediatric act to have been delivered in such large quantities.;","millions of people around the world are afflicted with malaria every year with children and pregnant women particularly hard hit.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; medicines for malaria venture was established as a not-for-profit public-private partnership in switzerland in 1999, following talks between the world health organization (who) and the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers and associations (ifpma). mmv brings public, private and philanthropic partners together to fund and manage the discovery, development and delivery of new medicines for the treatment and prevention of malaria.; mmv is funded by foundations, governments and corporations. regarded by who and the roll back malaria partnership as an important partner, it now manages the largest portfolio of malaria medicine research in history, with nearly 40 projects underway at the end of 2008. mmv has mini-portfolio agreements with genzyme, glaxosmithkline, merck, novartis and sanofi. other partners include chong qing holley, msd, shin poong and sigma-tau.; mmv subsidizes 30 scientists at gsk's dedicated ddw research facility in tres cantos. as compounds move into clinical development, gsk provides clinical, regulatory and manufacturing expertise and resources via its global r&d and supply network. in 2008, gsk announced a new collaboration with mmv to identify novel drugs for the treatment of malaria. research will focus on macrolide antibiotics, which may help treat drug-resistant malaria. gsk and mmv are currently developing tafenoquine, a potential new treatment for the radical cure of p vivax malaria).; the novartis institute for tropical diseases is working with mmv to help to prevent, treat and block the spread of malaria by developing new classes of drugs that attack both liver and blood stages. in 2009, novartis and mmv introduced coartem®dispersible, the first artemisinin-based combination (act) formulation developed for children with malaria. the medicine contains the same concentration of active ingredients as the regular tablet, but in a dispersible formulation that is easier to give to babies and children, which helps to ensure that this population receives the correct dose. the sweet-tasting formulation dissolves quickly in small amounts of water which enhances its use in young children. in june 2016, novartis announced the expansion of its partnership with mmv to develop kaf156. novartis will lead the development of this compound with scientific and financial support from mmv in collaboration with the bill & melinda gates foundation. kaf156, currently in phase iib clinical development, belongs to a novel class of antimalarial compounds that act against both the blood and liver stages of the parasite's lifecycle. in september 2016, novartis published proof of concept study results in the new england journal of medicine showing that kaf156 demonstrated activity against both vivax and falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant parasites.; in 2008, mmv signed a mou with sanofi for discovery work, including early-stage molecule testing, and screening, plus clinical development of ferroquine, sar97276 and trioxaquine. starting in 2009, mmv contributed to the dndi and sanofi 'asaq field monitoring program' in côte d'ivoire. with approximately 15,000 patients, this is the largest study ever done on an antimalarial and should help african experts and government bodies to develop innovative pharmacovigilance methods in 'real life' conditions. in 2011 sanofi and mmv announced a three-year agreement to research malaria treatments titled “orthology malaria”.  as part of the agreement, both parties will work together to identify, characterize and optimize new candidate compounds to treat malaria and conduct early development programs to demonstrate proof of concept in men.;

summary of impact and forward looking information; the access dialogue on innovative access and ip provided an open space for insightful and critical dialogue on how best merck can utilize its capacities and competencies to address the affordability challenge.  the meeting helped realize common ground and opportunity for collaboration and collective action towards improving access to under-served populations through innovative thinking around innovative access and ip.  the meeting also demonstrated the crucial role of all stakeholders in ensuring a proactive and collaborative approach to ip.; following the access dialogue on innovative access and ip, merck joined wipo re:search, an open innovation consortium, sponsored by wipo, which shares intellectual property (ip) and know- how with the global health community with over 90 members. the platform contributes towards the accelerated research of new technologies and products to combat neglected tropical diseases (ntds), malaria and tuberculosis (tb), with the aim of benefitting patients in least developed countries (ldcs).; during the access dialogue on accessibility challenges, it was agreed that supply chain management in developing countries could benefit from coordination between the diverse stakeholders involved in this field. at the moment, there are overlaps between the various country initiatives and country capacity could be better utilized. participants concluded that there is value in all stakeholders working together to overcome delivery challenges and capture synergies.; from the meeting, the concept of an accessibility platform to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices as well as the undertaking of joint problem solving emerged. through this initiative, the platform hopes to identify the most pressing supply-chain challenges to access to health and generate ideas on how wider sector can collectively contribute to developing solutions.; this collaboration could translate into a more effective use of existing supply chains, supported by evidence provided by diverse stakeholders, including the industry, international organizations, supply chain experts, ngos, civil society, academics, and cross-sector representatives, among others. through the exchange of ideas and collective action we hope to break away from siloed-approaches, thus contributing to the new sustainable development goals.;","merck;","business for social responsibility (bsr);

more recently, many of the program activities have focused on sustainability and government scalability.  for example, in early 2014, the nigerian government launched a national chw scale up initiative in abuja, based on the mvp’s advisory work over the past two and a half years with the government of nigeria.  the mvp program also helped lay the foundation for a major campaign to expand chws and their efforts to help countries achieve the health-related mdgs. in 2013, the earth institute launched the one million community health worker campaign to expand and accelerate chw programs in sub-saharan african countries.;                                             ; *msd is known as merck in the u.s. and canada; ;","africa has the greatest proportion of people living in extreme poverty — more than 32 percent or roughly 300 million people living on less than usd 1 a day. the continent’s environmental, epidemiological and geographical challenges — including low-productivity agriculture, a high disease burden, and high transport costs render african countries most vulnerable to persistent extreme poverty. the majority of malaria-related deaths occur in sub-saharan africa, and a significant number of africans suffer from water-related diseases and malnutrition. there is also a high rate of maternal mortality. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:; since 2009, with support of almost $2 million from the msd*'s merck foundation through 2013, the earth institute at columbia university has been conducting a community health worker (chw) training program to strengthen community health services for more than 400,000 people in 10 african countries, as part of the millennium villages project (mvp). the initiative aims to advance the development of a professional cadre of chws to fill a critical gap in the delivery of primary healthcare for rural communities throughout africa. the program helps ensure that participating community health workers are skilled, well-trained, properly remunerated, regularly supervised and fully integrated into their countries' healthcare systems.; a component of the program is the improvement of service delivery through informed decision-making processes and rigorous information feedback loops among communities, clinics, and management systems. the mvp-designed mobile health platform, commcare, is being used to monitor performance of the chws.  compiled in a monthly performance report, these “real-time” data allow managers and program advisors to identify areas for improvement, such as the tracking of vital statistics or quality improvement of case management, and to implement targeted chw trainings. these data also facilitate the assessment of individual chw performance, allowing managers to incentivize or promote the highest performing chws and to target performance improvement efforts for lower-performing chws.; to take full advantage of these efforts, the mvp team will incorporate the outcomes of the chw program successes and its most recent scale-up efforts into policy recommendations and national implementation guides for each of the 10 countries where millennium villages are located. in addition, the mvp team will engage the national ministries of health to foster health policy dialogue as a bridge to long-term, sustainable in-country support for mvp activities.;

"257","Mobilize Against Malaria","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; according to the world health organization, malaria is the leading cause of mortality in children under five in africa and constitutes 10 percent of the continent’s overall disease burden.  this partnership was designed to address critical gaps in malaria treatment and education in ghana, senegal and kenya.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; in each of the three program countries, pfizer provided support to leading non-governmental organizations to implement and evaluate effective malaria interventions.; in ghana, pfizer helped  bring the public and private sectors together to find new solutions to the malaria challenge. the program specifically supported family health international and ghana social marketing foundation which demonstrated that investments in ghana's licensed chemical sellers, small retail outlets which act as a major source of basic medicines, can dramatically improve malaria treatment, diagnosis and prevention. through pfizer's partners, thousands of licensed chemical sellers (lcss) received training and job support and developied closer ties to the communities they serve. in kenya, pfizer helped population services international to reduce malaria in pregnant women and children under five, two groups most at-risk for malaria-related mortality and morbidity. while kenya is one of the most progressive african countries in terms of malaria programming, resources are still needed to reach women and healthcare providers, especially in hard-to-reach rural communities. recognizing that more than 70% of women attend antenatal clinics at least once during their pregnancy, pfizer's partners are providing a boost to healthcare providers and patients at these clinics by supplying improved training, health education and new information packets designed especially for new mothers.; in senegal, pfizer worked with intrahealth international to strengthen the country's system of health huts, rudimentary clinics which are often the only healthcare facility accessible to rural communities. during the rainy season, when populations become even more isolated, these clinics frequently function without running water, electricity, adequate supplies or medicines. recognizing the critically important role these health huts play in the country's healthcare system, pfizer and its partners are investing in improving their infrastructure, malaria training, supply chain, provider skills, and community demand for services.; lessons learned; early partnerships position partners for success because of their collective skills and experience. partner selection should expand beyond technical expertise to include long-term strengths that may be required later in the program. in advance of proposal preparation, collaborating parties should discuss and formally agree on the rules of engagement.; the ghana program focused on building capacity of lcs in the management and treatment of malaria, and did not give consideration to other skills areas that would have made it possible for them to meet broader pharmacy council requirements. lcs capacity building initiatives should include other areas of their operation to ensure sustainability of the program.; because lcss were not regarded as part of the health delivery system, it was difficult to convince clinicians and other public health sector stakeholders that lcss could be trained to distinguish complicated malaria and conduct referral of severe cases and pregnant women to the health centers. changing the operational culture of lcss that are hardly supervised and working with dhmts that are not mandated to work with lcss required engagement processes beyond the six months used in each district.; engaging relevant stakeholders and leveraging support for program goals can accelerate its implementation significantly. in the case of mam, goals were in alignment with those of national malaria control programs and ministries of health. mam teams led strong advocacy campaigns and brought key representatives from all relevant sectors together to ensure they are well informed about the program.;

in 2005, the merck (msd*) foundation and the government of china established the first large-scale comprehensive public/private partnership known as the china-msd hiv/aids partnership (c-map), to address hiv and aids prevention, patient care, treatment and support, in support of ""china's action plan for reducing & preventing the spread of hiv/aids, 2006-2010."" the partners introduced the program in liangshan prefecture, sichuan province, with the aim of developing a model that could be replicated in other provinces.; the merck foundation committed usd $30 million over eight years (2005-2012) to support this partnership.. the government of china, through its ministry of health, is providing staff, facilities and equipment. c-map has project offices in three places: in beijing; in chengdu, the capital of sichuan province; and in sichuan province’s liangshan prefecture.; c-map is focused on six goals:; c-map collaborates with approximately 11,500 people working in 1,600 implementing organizations, including departments within the government of china, medical and health institutions, civil societies, international organizations, grassroots healthcare workers, and beneficiary groups.; in october 2013, the merck foundation committed an addidtional $6 million over three years (2014-2016) to support a second phase of c-map to strengthen integrated hiv treatment capacity and cooperation between the township and county health systems of liangshan prefecture, and to expand the program to new sites in chongqing municipality and fujian province to improve hiv/aids management and treatment services. during this next phase, c-map aims to further improve treatment coverage by strengthening the capacity of healthcare workers to support the implementation of effective patient referrals and promote quality hiv treatment through health worker training in hiv diagnosis, treatment and  disease management.; summary of impact and forward looking information; c-map was the first large-scale public-private partnership between the chinese government and a private multinational company focusing on hiv/aids prevention, treatment and control.; since 2007, in addition to raising awareness, the partnership has successfully established an overall hiv prevention and treatment network in liangshan.this, coupled with training, has helped improve the capacity of local healthcare providers, expand antiretroviral treatment (art) coverage, and created a replicable model for hiv prevention and control in other ethnic-minority areas. the collaboration brought new technologies to strengthen the testing capabilities of local labs, provided necessary lab equipment and medical supplies, and developed healthcare services specifically targeted to pregnant women to help prevent mother-to-child transmission.; in 2011, the china-msd hiv/aids partnership received china's most prestigious award in the charity field, the china charity award — most influential charity program, which distinguishes significant contributions to public welfare and charity work in china.;

"265","MSD for Mothers","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; every two minutes, a woman dies from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. if nothing is done an estimated three million women may die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth in the next decade. most of these deaths are preventable.; while the burden falls most heavily on the developing world, certain communities in the united states and other developed nations are suffering significant and worsening rates of maternal death.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; in september, 2011 msd* announced the launch of msd for mothers (known as merck** for mothers in the u.s. and canada), a 10-year, $500 million initiative focused on creating a world where no woman has to die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. drawing on the company's history of discovering innovative, life-saving medicines and vaccines, msd for mothers is applying msd's scientific and business expertise – as well as its financial resources and experience in taking on tough global healthcare challenges – to reduce maternal mortality around the world.; msd for mothers is working with approximately 75 partners on more than 50 projects to improve the maternal health of women in 30 countries.  the focus is on the two leading causes of death - post-partum hemorrhage and preeclampsia - as well as family planning, which is known to play an important role in saving women’s lives.; working in close collaboration with partners, the program operates like a “living laboratory,” designing and testing health solutions for women that can achieve broad scale.  each day, they look for new ways to confront the complex challenge of maternal mortality by adapting the core strategies that have helped us succeed as a global healthcare company. ; in india, senegal, uganda, the us and zambia 2656 health facilities have been strengthened to provide quality care, 10,875 health workers have been trained and nearly 6 million women now have access to affordable, quality care and modern contraception.; companies rely on multidisciplinary teams to drive innovation, execution, and progress. the success of msd for mothers is enhanced by bringing together partners from all sectors that share the msd mission of saving women’s lives.; summary of impact and forward looking information; msd collaborated with path, an ngo leader in global health technology, to identify game-changing technologies with potential to save the lives of women during pregnancy and childbirth in low-resource settings. through this collaboration they developed a tool to help prioritize technologies that have the greatest potential to save women’s lives. this is looking at criteria including cost, efficacy, and ease of use in resource-limited settings – as well as commercial viability – to help inform decisions about where to invest scarce resources to reduce maternal mortality. to date, path has assessed more than 50 technologies designed to reduce maternal mortality and has made the findings publicly available.; in india, msd is strengthening the capacity of private health providers to meet clinical standards for maternal care. in partnership with local organizations, including the country’s association of ob/gyns, msd is streamlining the process for nearly 150 providers to become accredited so they are eligible to participate in government financing schemes.; in uganda, msd for mothers supports building a health ecosystem: strengthening franchise clinics, engaging local transport providers to improve linkages to care, working with drug shops to provide essential supplies, promoting savings schemes, and training community health workers to raise awareness about safe motherhood and the importance of giving birth in a facility.  in one year, the partners in uganda added nearly 40 new clinics, trained 150 drug shop owners, established more than 25 “mothers clubs,” and recruited more than 120 community health workers. the program is expected to reach more than 150,000 women over the next three years.; the partnerships in zambia are focused on researching and designing new models of maternity waiting homes, the residential facilities located at or near health facilities where women in the late stages of pregnancy can stay before giving birth. between 2015-2018, the project aims to have 24 maternity waiting homes linked to high quality health facilities in 8 districts.msd is also working in uganda and zambia as a partner in saving mothers, giving life, a public-private partnership designed to dramatically reduce maternal and newborn mortality in sub-saharan africa.   since 2012, the partnership has reduced maternal mortality ratios by 53 % in target facilities in zambia and 45% in target facilities in uganda. the success of the partnership means it will now expand the program to cross river state in nigeria.; in partnership with the government of senegal, msd for mothers is supporting the national expansion of an innovative model that offers private suppliers performance-based financial incentives to maintain a sufficient inventory of contraceptives and make sure these products are consistently available. all regions are covered across the country and 1,404 health facilities are already participating, with 3.2 million women who now have access to modern contraception. ;

in september, 2011 msd* announced the launch of msd for mothers (known as merck** for mothers in the u.s. and canada), a 10-year, $500 million initiative focused on creating a world where no woman has to die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. drawing on the company's history of discovering innovative, life-saving medicines and vaccines, msd for mothers is applying msd's scientific and business expertise – as well as its financial resources and experience in taking on tough global healthcare challenges – to reduce maternal mortality around the world.; msd for mothers is working with approximately 75 partners on more than 50 projects to improve the maternal health of women in 30 countries.  the focus is on the two leading causes of death - post-partum hemorrhage and preeclampsia - as well as family planning, which is known to play an important role in saving women’s lives.;

in india, msd is strengthening the capacity of private health providers to meet clinical standards for maternal care. in partnership with local organizations, including the country’s association of ob/gyns, msd is streamlining the process for nearly 150 providers to become accredited so they are eligible to participate in government financing schemes.; in uganda, msd for mothers supports building a health ecosystem: strengthening franchise clinics, engaging local transport providers to improve linkages to care, working with drug shops to provide essential supplies, promoting savings schemes, and training community health workers to raise awareness about safe motherhood and the importance of giving birth in a facility.  in one year, the partners in uganda added nearly 40 new clinics, trained 150 drug shop owners, established more than 25 “mothers clubs,” and recruited more than 120 community health workers. the program is expected to reach more than 150,000 women over the next three years.; the partnerships in zambia are focused on researching and designing new models of maternity waiting homes, the residential facilities located at or near health facilities where women in the late stages of pregnancy can stay before giving birth. between 2015-2018, the project aims to have 24 maternity waiting homes linked to high quality health facilities in 8 districts.msd is also working in uganda and zambia as a partner in saving mothers, giving life, a public-private partnership designed to dramatically reduce maternal and newborn mortality in sub-saharan africa.   since 2012, the partnership has reduced maternal mortality ratios by 53 % in target facilities in zambia and 45% in target facilities in uganda. the success of the partnership means it will now expand the program to cross river state in nigeria.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; as a founding partner in the gavi alliance, a historic public-private partnership committed to saving children's lives and protecting people's health by increasing access to immunization in lowest income countries, msd responded to this public health challenge by launching a multi-year philanthropic initiative to help strengthen the capacity of expanded program on immunization (epi) health workers in sub-saharan africa.; in 2003, with funding from the merck company foundation and after a competitive grant application process, mvn-a grantees established training programs in both kenya and mali. based on their success, renewed funding was provided to both programs in 2007, enabling both mvn-a grantees to extend training to additional health workers in kenya and mali and explore innovative training methods to address emerging immunization management needs. following a second competitive grant application process in 2007, the merck company foundation provided supplemental funding to enable two new mvn-a grantees to establish immunization training programs in uganda and zambia.; the four mvn-a training programs provided mid- to high-level immunization program managers with customized, hands-on training in vaccine management and immunization services. each mvn-a program was managed and administered by two primary institutions that have forged a broader collaborative partnership of key national stakeholders including ministries of health and education, non-governmental organizations, medical and nursing schools, and multilateral organizations such as who and unicef.; lessons learned; the mvn-a programs have found that, while cascade training appears to be an efficient way to reach several management levels, it requires extensive ""training of trainers"" and targeted follow-up to effectively reach epi health workers at peripheral levels. supervisory training can enhance the dissemination of information to peripheral health centers. to maintain high immunization coverage, the mvn-a training programs identified a need to improve supportive supervision practices in each country. further, they also noted the importance of making public resources available to conduct more frequent, focused training of mid-level epi managers to support evolving national immunization priorities.     ; summary of impact through december 2013 and forward looking information; from 2003-2010, mvn-a programs in kenya, mali, uganda and zambia trained more than 1,000 epi health workers across all four countries. trainees have returned to their home medical facilities to share their expertise and knowledge with fellow health care workers.; in all four countries, ""training of trainers"" sessions conducted by ministry of health and who epi personnel enhanced the national training capacity of the mvn-a programs. a cadre of local mvn-a trainers is now available to sustain these efforts in each country, supported by the ministry of health and other national stakeholders.; as the partnership drew to an end,  mvn-a collaborators advanced efforts to sustain their training programs in close partnership with key national stakeholders. ministries of health remain highly committed partners in all four programs, having enlisted mvn-a graduates to conduct operational level training (kenya, mali, uganda), disease outbreak responses (kenya, uganda), mass immunization campaigns in camps of internally-displaced persons (kenya) and new vaccine introductions (kenya, mali and zambia). coverage surveys have also provided additional information regarding immunization practice and identify factors that helped to improve vaccine coverage.;

summary of impact through december 2013 and forward looking information; from 2003-2010, mvn-a programs in kenya, mali, uganda and zambia trained more than 1,000 epi health workers across all four countries. trainees have returned to their home medical facilities to share their expertise and knowledge with fellow health care workers.; in all four countries, ""training of trainers"" sessions conducted by ministry of health and who epi personnel enhanced the national training capacity of the mvn-a programs. a cadre of local mvn-a trainers is now available to sustain these efforts in each country, supported by the ministry of health and other national stakeholders.; as the partnership drew to an end,  mvn-a collaborators advanced efforts to sustain their training programs in close partnership with key national stakeholders. ministries of health remain highly committed partners in all four programs, having enlisted mvn-a graduates to conduct operational level training (kenya, mali, uganda), disease outbreak responses (kenya, uganda), mass immunization campaigns in camps of internally-displaced persons (kenya) and new vaccine introductions (kenya, mali and zambia). coverage surveys have also provided additional information regarding immunization practice and identify factors that helped to improve vaccine coverage.;  ; *merck & co. ; **msd is known as merck in the usa and canada;","in sub-saharan africa, more than 8.3 million infants each year do not receive the most basic vaccines. one major reason for low vaccination rates in developing countries, according to the world health organization, is the lack of skilled health care professionals. as part of msd's** commitment to the gavi alliance, it established the merck* vaccine network - africa (mvn-a) to develop sustainable immunization training centers in africa. one of msd's major programs in africa, mvn-a reflected the company's commitment to improving access to medicines, vaccines and health care in the developing world.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; as a founding partner in the gavi alliance, a historic public-private partnership committed to saving children's lives and protecting people's health by increasing access to immunization in lowest income countries, msd responded to this public health challenge by launching a multi-year philanthropic initiative to help strengthen the capacity of expanded program on immunization (epi) health workers in sub-saharan africa.; in 2003, with funding from the merck company foundation and after a competitive grant application process, mvn-a grantees established training programs in both kenya and mali. based on their success, renewed funding was provided to both programs in 2007, enabling both mvn-a grantees to extend training to additional health workers in kenya and mali and explore innovative training methods to address emerging immunization management needs. following a second competitive grant application process in 2007, the merck company foundation provided supplemental funding to enable two new mvn-a grantees to establish immunization training programs in uganda and zambia.;

furthermore, these villages face constant threat of water pollution due to urbanization, industrialization, agricultural run-off and improper agricultural and social religious practices. the waters of river narmada represent the only source of drinking water for the communities settled along them. due to consumption of this water, which is often contaminated, the population is at risk to water borne diseases of infectious or chemical nature which can also be fatal. thus, it is necessary to increase awareness about the ‘usability’ of the water from the narmada river on a regular basis.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the river ambulance aims to reach underserved communities living along the river narmada and to deliver them primary healthcare. this project was launched by narmada samagra (an indian ngo) in 2007 in madhya pradesh, india to reduce the pollution of the narmada river banks and waters as well as to protect the health of tribes and communities settled around the banks.; the river ambulance can travel in 2-3 feet deep water the health services reach the door steps of people living in these remote areas. these ambulances are equipped with telephone connections that can be used as a helpline and can raft at a speed of 30 kms/hr in case of emergencies. each ambulance contains: a bed for ferrying patients to nearest hospital in emergency, primary surgical tools, safety equipments (floating jackets, air tube etc), refrigerator for keeping injections and medicines, oxygen cylinder for emergency patients, medical kit with stethoscope, medicines and register for patient entry, test kits for heart related tests and different pathology tests like blood group, haemoglobin, sugar, pregnancy, malaria etc and solar cell panel for power requirement.; merck is supporting and scaling-up narmada samagra river ambulance program through financial operational support, additional boat donation and provision of volunteer doctors to ensure that more patients will be reached. merck has initiated daily testing of pollution levels of the river by deploying 55 dedicated personnel for the same along 100 banks. the merck millipore water testing kits are used for this purpose.; the initiative is part of merck’s efforts around accessibility which focus on strengthening supply chain and develop localized health solutions to deliver and reach out efficiently at the point of care, thereby providing health workers, communities and patients with consistent access to health solutions, irrespective of their geographical location.; merck’s support to the ngo narmada samagara contributes to the stability of the river ambulance project whose functioning is dependent on donations and a regular supply of medicines and products. the river ambulance helps expand access to health services and solutions to under-served tribal and local populations along the narmada river, who are often exploited by local primary health centers and city doctors demanding steep fees. the program is scaling-up with the addition of one boat donated by merck who will provide volunteer doctors and support operational expenses to help reach more patients along the river. merck has also initiated daily testing of pollution levels of the river narmada, a new activity as part of this project. this will allow for daily testing of river water by trained local community members using water testing kits as a way of informing local populations about the pollution levels of the river, aiding in preventative healthcare.; this initiative currently benefits over 40 villages on the banks of the narmada river, providing locals with access to healthcare and solutions. the service runs five days a week attending to around 40-50 people each day, covering 200km along the banks of the river. since 2014, the program has reached out to  more than 12,000 people.; in 2016, merck donated a new boat to the initiative, a boat that can carry more materials and staff, and it can also transport more emergency cases.; in the month of april 2014, 55 personnel were trained for using the water test kits by a certified technician in bhopal and started water testing on the banks in may 2014.;

"274","National Expansion of Breast & Cervical cancer Screening in Swaziland","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; to expand the availability of breast & cervical cancer screening for prevention, early detection and treatment of these cancers within the country and in doing so reduce the rate of disease and death.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; there are still a large number of women who do not screen regularly in the country and as a result of the high hiv rate many are highly at risk of cervical cancer. many avoid prevention opportunities due to misunderstanding or cannot take them up if educated due to financial, transport or family barriers.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the partnership formed between sbccn, bmsf and ministry of health was aimed at increasing the number of clinics in the country able to provide screening and prevention for cervical cancer and basic breast screening at the same time. the partnership included baylor intgernation pediatrics aids initiative (bipai) as one of 14 clinics however bipai has also become a key partner in training and capacity development of the target sites. the partnership has already allowed since 2015 thousands of additional women to access screening in locations where they previously could not or would have screen due to challenges with transport funds and long distance travel as well as hospital queues in the few previously open clinics.; summary of impact and forward looking information; the impact of the partnerships is in its early stages but can already be seen in the high numbers of women attending some of the new clinics for screening and treatment. many women have reported to new sites for screening who have immediately been diagnosed and treated for pre-cancer or cancerous damage and may otherwise have not survived if the additional sites were not implemented. the rate of cervical damage being so high in swaziland indicates the need for the new clinics and in time it is anticipated many thousands of lives will be saved by prevention through the treatment of pre cervical cancer and the detection of breast cancer at early treatable stages which is also being observed already in the dedicated breast referral clinics.;

while current anti-filarial treatments are effective against larvae and microfilariae, they require many years of consistent, annual mass drug administration in a given endemic community in order to also successfully eliminate the adult worms. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; anti-wolbachia therapy is a new method of treatment that eradicates the adult worms that can cause filariasis by eliminating bacteria known as wolbachia that live in the cells of their bodies. as filariae are dependent on these wolbachia for growth, development, reproduction and survival, these worms can be effectively eradicated by first eliminating the wolbachia inside them.; anti-wolbachia therapy is expected to lead to worm sterility and effective worm eradication, thereby reducing treatment timeframes and providing superior therapeutic outcomes compared to existing anti-filarial drugs. further, as anti-wolbachia programs are still in their infancy, this collaboration is expected to potentially provide a unique opportunity to make a significant contribution to communities affected by filariasis.; eisai has entered into a collaboration with the liverpool school of tropical medicine (lstm) and the university of liverpool to jointly identify new drugs effective against lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis (river blindness), both major types of filariasis. under the collaboration, eisai works with lstm and the university of liverpool to identify and develop novel drug candidates that efficiently eliminate the bacteria wolbachia. ; this approach has the potential to significantly reduce the timescale of elimination programs, to provide alternatives to existing treatments, and to deliver tools that can be used in areas where current approaches are failing or cannot be deployed. doxycycline, an antibiotic, is believed to work in this way and proof of concept has already been established in human field trials, which showed excellent results although requiring four to six weeks of daily treatment and being unsuitable for administration to children and pregnant women.; summary of impact and forward looking information; on february 2017 a candidate compound has been identified for this project. this compound is effective in eliminating wolbachia in in vitro assays, it eliminates macrofilaria in in vivo animal models and has a desirable pharmacokinetic profile. the compound is being profiled for safety currently.;

nclca workshops include:; summary of impact and forward looking information; by passing knowledge on to local health workers, nclca reaches between 800 and 1,000 patients every year. the adoption of the nclca’s modalities – such as grip aids, self-care kits and health education booklets – by the indian government has increased impact even beyond these numbers. over the past years, nearly 28,000 self-care kits were distributed to patients through the indian national leprosy eradication program. other countries such as myanmar, tanzania and sri lanka have also adopted tools developed by the nclca.; despite these successes, leprosy control is at a critical juncture today. the disease has limited spread and thus the level of international attention and political commitment is declining. in an effort to contribute to the last mile by disseminating knowledge about leprosy among health workers, the novartis foundation published the eighth edition of  leprosy – for medical practitioners and paramedical workers.;

"286","Novartis Healthy Family programs","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; in many developing countries, most people live in rural or semi-urban villages. health education, health-seeking behavior and health expenditure are low in these communities, where women and children are especially affected by health problems. health problems are also amplified by poor sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and a lack of clean water. in many communities, tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, mother and child malnutrition, gastrointestinal problems and an alarming rate of infant mortality are common. in india, for example, more than 65% of the population have limited or no access to healthcare, primarily due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; in 2007, novartis launched “arogya parivar” in india, the first of several novartis healthy family program. novartis healthy family is a social business model that builds local, sustainable capabilities for healthcare in developing countries.; arogya parivar (“healthy family” in hindi) works with local resources and empowers villagers to help themselves. novartis recruits and trains locals in remote villages to become “health educators,” who help inform communities about health, disease prevention and the benefits of seeking timely treatment. local teams also work with doctors to organize health camps in remote villages – mobile clinics that provide access to screening, diagnosis and therapies. “health supervisors” serve as the initiative’s local sales force, interacting with local pharmacies and doctors.; the program, which became self-sustaining in less than three years, offers more than 100 effective, low-cost medications for communicable and non-conmmunicable diseases that are prevalent in rural india. its 500 traveling health educators and sales supervisors have become a welcome sight. ; given arogya parivar’s success in india, novartis has rolled out similar programs in vietnam and kenya. the initiative has been adapted to local market conditions and disease prevalence in each country. in vietnam, the healthy family model is based on a public-private partnership. healthcare professionals in public health roles collaborate with novartis and travel to rural areas to conduct health awareness sessions as well as diagnose patients. medical college students teach primary and secondary school children about the importance of proper hand washing, nutrition, exercise and keeping a healthy heart.; from 2010 to 2016, outreach in rural areas across the three countries has brought health education to more than 30 million people and direct health benefits to 3 million patients through diagnosis and treatment. in 2016 alone, together, the programs reached more than 7.7 million people through health education sessions.  nearly 610,000 patients attended specific health camps triggering positive health-seeking behavior.; the product portfolio is adapted to focus on diseases most prevalent in rural areas of each country. to be included in the portfolio, products need to be simple to use, relevant to local patients and have instructions in local languages. the current portfolio of medicines includes tb and rabies treatments, antibiotics, topical anti-infectives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-fungal, anxiety treatments, diabetes medicines as well as gynecological treatments. nutritional supplements, as well as products to treat cough, cold, allergies, diarrhea and calcium deficiencies are also part of the portfolio.; through the initiative, local women gain access to products needed during pregnancy and birth, including calcium, nutritional supplements and oxytocin, the who-recommended treatment for postpartum hemorrhage, which is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries.; awareness; health educators hold regular health education meetings that focus on prevention, hygiene, nutrition, and common prevalent diseases and their symptoms. physicians are also educated through knowledge sharing and medical detailing of treatment options.; accessibility; the program ensures consistent availability of medicines and healthcare in rural settings. in india, for instance, strong links with more than 60,000 doctors, pharmacists and distributors help to make medicines available in the most remote pharmacies. through health camps, qualified doctors travel to rural areas to provide screening, diagnosis, treatment and preventive care.; adaptability; communications, product packaging and training are adaptable to local conditions. the product portfolio is also customized based on the local disease burden. local health educators are recruited to adapt the program to local dialects and culture.;

"287","Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD)","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; one of the challenges of discovering drugs for diseases of the developing world is the lack of basic research into the underlying causes of these diseases – an example of this is dengue fever. dengue fever is caused by any one of -the four serotypes of dengue viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. the challenge in dengue drug discovery is the limited knowledge about virus infection cycle and the lack of understanding of the relationship between viremia and severe disease progression. novartis is one of the few large pharmaceutical companies working on research for dengue fever at nitd.; about 2.5 billion people, or 40 percent of the world’s population, lives in areas where there is a risk of dengue transmission and a certain small percentage of the infected patients develop into -life-threatening hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome that can lead to death. over the past four decades, dengue disease has become recognized as the world's most important mosquito-borne viral disease.; malaria kills an estimated 429,000 people each year, mostly among african children.  in south east asia, the first signs of drug resistance against the malaria parasite have been reported and new drugs different from the current arsenal of antimalarials are needed to fight the resistant parasites.; screening for drugs effective in infectious diseases is challenging because of the often limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and the death of validated drug targets. the best way to screen is thus to use the whole organism and look for compounds that cause cell death – human african trypanosomiasis is one example. an estimated 70 million people, in sub-saharan africa are at risk of contracting human african trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly. 7,197 new cases were reported in 2012, however it is acknowledged that cases are under-reported and that who estimates the number of actual cases to be 30,000. current treatments have complicated administration regimes and have serious adverse side-effects.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the novartis institute for tropical diseases is a part of the novartis institutes for biomedical research that, in partnership with other organizations, is dedicated to drug discovery research on neglected diseases for the developing world. as a small-molecule drug discovery research institute, it combines the drug-discovery expertise and cutting-edge technologies of novartis to fight infectious tropical diseases, including dengue fever, human african trypanosomiasis and malaria. the nitd international team of scientists is engaged in neglected disease research efforts, from target discovery and screening development to compound optimization and preparation for clinical testing.; the nitd dengue team has worked with many of singapore local and international collaborators to establish novel research tools and approaches, characterizing ns4b target to enable -drug discovery, establishing -dengue animal models for antiviral testing, defining structure and function of dengue viral proteins, and developing screening assays which have been used to identify several candidate compounds in the fight against dengue. in the area of malaria, novartis is currently initiating clinical studies of two anti-malaria treatments developed at nitd, including a promising new candidate against drug-resistant malaria which is active on both vivax and falciparum malaria. this new class of antimalarial compound, termed spiroindolones, was discovered and developed from a chemical hit out of the novartis compound library. an extensive medicinal chemical optimization campaign which focused on improving the activity and the physicochemical or drug-like properties of the molecule lead to the development of kae609. kae609 is the first new class of antimalarial with a different mode of action to the current drugs to enter clinical trials in over 20 years. in addition, a clinical proof-of-concept study in malaria with kaf156, an imidazolepiperazine, achieved a positive outcome (parasite clearance of plasmodium vivax and falciparum) and this compound is now moving forward in partnership with a new formulation of the antimalarial lumefantrine into phase 2b studies. novartis will lead the development of antimalarial compound kaf156 with scientific and financial support from medicines for malaria venture in collaboration with the bill & melinda gates foundation. novartis has also identified pi4k as a new drug target with potential to prevent, block and treat malaria.;

"288","Novartis Malaria Initiative","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; malaria is one of the world’s biggest killers and africa's leading cause of mortality for children under five: every 2 minutes, a child dies of malaria in africa. there were an estimated 212 million cases of malaria in 2015, causing an estimated 429,000 deaths.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the novartis malaria initiative focuses on improving access to treatment, helping communities in malaria-endemic countries deliver better healthcare and investing in research and development into the next generation of antimalarials. focused on treatment, access, and capacity building, the initiative is tailored to best meet patient needs. ; in 1999, novartis  launched coartem®, the first fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) antimalarial, prequalified by the who for its efficacy, safety and quality (and on the who’s model list of essential medicines). coartem® has a cure rate of over 95% of patients after a 3-day treatment course and a demonstrated safety profile. coartem® combines artemether, a derivative of artemisinin (from the chinese medicinal plant artemisia annua), with a synthetic substance, lumefantrine. lumefantrine has never been used as a monotherapy reducing the risk of resistance against the treatment compared to other acts.  in 2009, novartis and medicines for malaria venture (mmv) introduced coartem® dispersible, the first act formulation specifically developed to address the treatment needs of millions of children with malaria. although children are the most vulnerable to malaria, there was until then no treatment adapted for this patient group. prior to this innovative pediatric medicine, health workers and parents had to crush bitter-tasting antimalarial tablets for children to swallow.; sweet-tasting coartem®dispersible tablets dissolve quickly in small amounts of water, easing administration and ensuring effective dosing for children. coartem®dispersible contains the same amounts of artemether and lumefantrine as coartem® tablets (20mg/120mg) and delivers the same high cure rates.; however, rising resistance to artemisinin and decreasing drug efficiency threatens the global control of malaria, meaning new drugs are needed. in september 2016, novartis published proof of concept study results showing that its new antimalarial compound, kaf156, demonstrated activity against both plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum, two main parasites responsible for the majority of malaria deaths. this drug is even shown to work against artemisinin-resistant parasites. in line with who guidance that antimalarials be co-formulated to mitigate the risk of parasite resistance development, it is expected that kaf156 will become part of a combination regimen when used to treat malaria. ; education being a key factor in malaria control, the novartis malaria initiative developed a program to train healthcare workers and the communities they serve. this includes materials and courses for healthcare workers and mothers/caregivers – translated into several languages and distributed free of charge. ; further, novartis also brings together the managers of national malaria control programs across africa to share best practice in community awareness, healthcare worker training, stock management and distribution, and health impact measurement. in 2016, the fifteenth nmcp workshop was held in senegal.; in an effort to tackle stock-outs of antimalarials in malaria-endemic countries, novartis joined forces with private and public partners to launch sms for life in 2009. the program uses mobile and digital technology to track stocks of key antimalarials and other essential medicines in rural health facilities. the program was initially launched in tanzania, but has since been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in kenya, ghana, the democratic republic of congo and cameroon. over the years, the scope of the program has also expanded to more disease areas and health parameters.; building on the success of sms for life, a new enhanced version, sms for life 2.0 was launched in 2016. in addition to stock visibility, the tablet-based platform enables to collect timely disease surveillance data and offers training programs and educational video resources to support the continuous education of health workers.; since the start, the novartis malaria initiative has worked with its chinese suppliers of artemether and lumefantrine to help them to improve manufacturing processes and productivity, raise product quality and achieve international gmp standards. assistance provided has included training in quality assurance, quality control, laboratory analysis, regulatory requirements and cost management. more recently, the novartis malaria initiative has also worked with partners to expand cultivation of artemisia annua in madagascar. ; lessons learned    ; malaria elimination requires action on several interconnected fronts – quality, affordability and accessibility of treatments are crucial, as well as effective case management, ensuring patient adherence and staying one step ahead of the parasite – but most importantly, it requires joint action and partnerships.; summary of impact and forward looking information; since 2001, novartis has provided more than 850 million treatment courses of coartem® and coartem®dispersible. further, since its launch in 2009, more than 300 million treatments of coartem®dispersible alone have been delivered without profit to 40 countries, mainly in africa, making it the first pediatric act to have been delivered in such large quantities.;

"290","Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH)","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; infectious diseases impose the major health burden in the developing world. there is a desperate need for effective, affordable and accessible vaccines to combat these neglected infectious diseases that affect over two billion people in the developing world. novartis is committed to improving global health and the novartis vaccines institute for global health (nvgh) is an important part of that strategy as they discover and develop vaccines specifically addressing the needs of developing countries.; invasive salmonella, shigella and meningitis are major neglected diseases of developing countries. together these diseases are responsible for well in excess of 160 million clinical cases per year with more than 1 million deaths. these diseases predominantly infect the poorest proportion of the population and particularly impact on young children.; a major bottleneck in the path to new vaccines is the expertise and facilities needed to turn a laboratory concept into high quality vaccines that are both clinically effective and economically viable for manufacture.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the novartis vaccines institute for global health (nvgh) is a part of the novartis institutes for biomedical research that, in partnership with other organizations, aims to develop effective and affordable vaccines for neglected infectious diseases of impoverished communities. in striving to achieve this mission, nvgh aims to substantially reduce development risks and cost of new vaccines so that manufacturers will be able to viably produce and distribute these vaccines to the public health sector of the developing world. nvgh's role is to undertake the translational research required to take a laboratory concept through development to the human proof of concept and then to transfer this knowledge to a manufacturer.; lessons learned                          ; new paradigms are needed for developing sustainable production of vaccines for neglected diseases and this will be the subject of ongoing investigations. in 2011 there was a major effort in addressing antigenic diversity of target antigens, particularly though a new partially eu funded initiative, gendrivax. this initiative involves multiple partners – demonstrating the power of combining academics and industry in the design of vaccine issues. for more on this initiative click here. ; summary of impact and forward looking information; on 2 march 2015, novartis announced the completion of a series of transactions with glaxosmithkline plc (gsk), including the divestiture of the novartis non-influenza vaccines business to gsk.;

"299","Oral Health and Hygiene Project","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES ; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; there are significant unmet needs in the area of oral health in sub-saharan africa.; with economic growth, rural communities in africa are increasingly exposed to western diets. although nutritious, those diets are high in refined sugars, which have been shown to increase tooth decay and periodontal disease. with increased access to food and the changing diet, often the pattern of food intake changes which can predispose to increase in caries.; oral diseases share many modifiable risk factors with the chronic diseases that are becoming more of a public health concern in africa and the rest of the developing world.  developing and testing behavioural change strategies to combat oral health problems not only fits well within the current implementation framework of gsk’s existing partnership with millenium villages project, but it could also have synergistic effects in slowing the growth of other health problems. ; poor oral hygiene and changed diets lead to increase in oral diseases. with increased prevalenceof tooth decay and periodontal disease, there is increased risk of oral infections spreading through the vascular system to other parts of the body causing, for example, heart diseases. thus, preventionof oral diseases by implementation of oral hygiene programs is a good investment in oral and in general health.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the oral health and hygiene pilot in the millennium villages consists of three distinct phases: ; the first includes planning and assessment, the second focuses on implementation and operational research, and the third on documenting findings and communicating them on a broader policy scale. assessment is a critical piece of the initial planning of the study design, as there is less knowledge of and academic consensus on how to address oral health and hygiene in the developing world than was the case for the phase (personal hygiene & sanitation education) handwashing program. moreover, it was critically important to ensure that the oral health component of the mvp was well integrated into the overall health strategy of the mvp.; the aim of the project is to:; lessons learned      ; in order to implement sustainable oral health behavioural and social interventions, it is imperative to include all sectors of the community in the base-line assessments. therefore, community leaders, health care workers, teachers, youth organizations, parents, farmers, traders, and representatives from women’s associations were invited to participate in the focus groups, surveys and workshops.; workshops were conducted to sensitize the community to oral health interventions, as well associal mobilization events to introduce capacity building and school program interventions. these focused on increasing awareness about good oral hygiene habits and proper brushing practices.; it was important to select schools that would implement daily supervised tooth brushing/ chewing stick use with a pre-and post-evaluation of defined outcomes.; in both senegal and ethiopia, all the focus groups acknowledged that oral problems in their village are widespread and severe;

oral diseases share many modifiable risk factors with the chronic diseases that are becoming more of a public health concern in africa and the rest of the developing world.  developing and testing behavioural change strategies to combat oral health problems not only fits well within the current implementation framework of gsk’s existing partnership with millenium villages project, but it could also have synergistic effects in slowing the growth of other health problems. ; poor oral hygiene and changed diets lead to increase in oral diseases. with increased prevalenceof tooth decay and periodontal disease, there is increased risk of oral infections spreading through the vascular system to other parts of the body causing, for example, heart diseases. thus, preventionof oral diseases by implementation of oral hygiene programs is a good investment in oral and in general health.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the oral health and hygiene pilot in the millennium villages consists of three distinct phases: ; the first includes planning and assessment, the second focuses on implementation and operational research, and the third on documenting findings and communicating them on a broader policy scale. assessment is a critical piece of the initial planning of the study design, as there is less knowledge of and academic consensus on how to address oral health and hygiene in the developing world than was the case for the phase (personal hygiene & sanitation education) handwashing program. moreover, it was critically important to ensure that the oral health component of the mvp was well integrated into the overall health strategy of the mvp.; the aim of the project is to:; lessons learned      ; in order to implement sustainable oral health behavioural and social interventions, it is imperative to include all sectors of the community in the base-line assessments. therefore, community leaders, health care workers, teachers, youth organizations, parents, farmers, traders, and representatives from women’s associations were invited to participate in the focus groups, surveys and workshops.; workshops were conducted to sensitize the community to oral health interventions, as well associal mobilization events to introduce capacity building and school program interventions. these focused on increasing awareness about good oral hygiene habits and proper brushing practices.; it was important to select schools that would implement daily supervised tooth brushing/ chewing stick use with a pre-and post-evaluation of defined outcomes.; in both senegal and ethiopia, all the focus groups acknowledged that oral problems in their village are widespread and severe; most thought that children were especially affected.; the focus groups also revealed a variety of local materials used for cleaning purposes as well as remedies for tooth pain and alternative traditional practices in both countries. in ethiopia, for example, toothpaste was rarely used as it was believed to be a cause of bad breath and tooth pain.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; this partnership researches and develops new medicines and/or new formulations of existing medicines to treat children with hiv/aids, especially in developing countries in sub-saharan africa and asia. in some cases, partners have signed licensing, patent and/or technology transfer agreements with generic drug manufacturers in south africa, india and brazil to make existing hiv/aids medicines available in developing countries at lower costs.; abbvie, first as abbott, has a long-standing commitment to the treatment of children with hiv. in 2007, abbvie (as abbott) launched the first lower-strength tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir in the developing world (uganda) before making the product available in developed countries. the lopinavir/ritonavir tablet is the only co-formulated protease inhibitor tablet that can be used in children (generic versions of this tablet formulation have been made available subsequent to 2007). the tablets do not require refrigeration and can be taken with or without a meal, an important advance in delivering hiv medicine in developing countries. the tablet is easier for children to take than its liquid formulation, which has been used in africa since 2001. the lower-strength tablet is sold at half the price of the original formulation in 69 countries, including all of africa.  abbvie is developing a sprinkle formulation of norvir, suitable for use in children living with hiv. the new powder has no alcohol or propylene glycol, has significantly improved shelf life from the liquid formulation currently in use, and will not require refrigeration.; bristol-myers squibb produces pediatric formulations of videx® (didanosine), zerit® (stavudine) and sustiva® (efavirenz) and works with the pediatric aids clinical trials group to develop reyataz® (atazanavir) for infants from 3 months old to 18 years. sustiva capsules are currently approved for use in children 3 years and older. sustiva is currently approved in the us for treatment of hiv-1 infection in combination with other arvs in adults and children 3 months or older who weigh at least 3.5 kg and for patients 3 years and older in other parts of the world.  bristol-myers squibb has studied a capsule sprinkle approach to dosing of sustiva in children 3 months of age and older. for more information about bristol-myers squibb’s initiatives to expand access to medicines for people with hiv/aids and people in developing countries click here. ; since 2009, glaxosmithkline's arv interests have been managed by viiv healthcare, a new hiv company founded with the singular purpose of research and development of hiv treatments. viiv healthcare has developed a number of arv liquid formulations for children, all available at access prices in the world's poorest countries. viiv healthcare has also committed to support multiple paediatric clinical trials in resource-poor countries to determine the best ways to expand access to hiv/aids treatment..; in 2010 viiv healthcare announced a partnership with clinton access health initiative (chai) and mylan laboratories to develop the fixed dose combinations abacavir/lamivudine for the treatment of infants and children. in this innovative partnership viiv healthcare, mylan and chai worked to bring respective expertise to develop a taste masked and dispersible product that was deemed of high clinical significance. in 2013, the who highlighted abc/3tc as a key medicine for the treatment of infants and children. viiv healthcare conducted the technical development of the product and provided finance and project management support for mylan to develop and file the product. mylan filed the product with the fda in october 2013.; recognising that 66% of the over 3 million children living with hiv worldwide do not have access to appropriate care and medicines, viiv healthcare has granted royalty-free voluntary licences for paediatric formulations of its existing and pipeline hiv medicines (including dolutegravir), in order to ensure that children in all least-developed, all low-income, and all sub-saharan african countries (where 99% of all children with hiv live) are able to receive high-quality, low-cost medicines.; viiv healthcare also supports collaborative research trials in resource-poor settings to understand public health issues such as prevention of mother-to-child hivtransmission and hiv-tb co-infection. in total, at the end of 2012, 93 clinical trials were underway; 14 of the 93 trials are paediatric studies. african countries participating in the paediatric studies include malawi, south africa, tanzania, uganda, zambia and zimbabwe.; as part of its ongoing work to deliver innovation in paediatric hiv treatment and care, viiv healthcare established a £10 million paediatric innovation seed fund. this fund specifically supports partnerships with organizations that focus on the evidence base for paediatric care and treatment, the research and development of paediatric fixed-dose combination (fdc) products, and formulations for the treatment of infants and children living with hiv. examples of partnerships developed to improve access to treatment and care include:;

bristol-myers squibb produces pediatric formulations of videx® (didanosine), zerit® (stavudine) and sustiva® (efavirenz) and works with the pediatric aids clinical trials group to develop reyataz® (atazanavir) for infants from 3 months old to 18 years. sustiva capsules are currently approved for use in children 3 years and older. sustiva is currently approved in the us for treatment of hiv-1 infection in combination with other arvs in adults and children 3 months or older who weigh at least 3.5 kg and for patients 3 years and older in other parts of the world.  bristol-myers squibb has studied a capsule sprinkle approach to dosing of sustiva in children 3 months of age and older. for more information about bristol-myers squibb’s initiatives to expand access to medicines for people with hiv/aids and people in developing countries click here. ; since 2009, glaxosmithkline's arv interests have been managed by viiv healthcare, a new hiv company founded with the singular purpose of research and development of hiv treatments. viiv healthcare has developed a number of arv liquid formulations for children, all available at access prices in the world's poorest countries. viiv healthcare has also committed to support multiple paediatric clinical trials in resource-poor countries to determine the best ways to expand access to hiv/aids treatment..; in 2010 viiv healthcare announced a partnership with clinton access health initiative (chai) and mylan laboratories to develop the fixed dose combinations abacavir/lamivudine for the treatment of infants and children. in this innovative partnership viiv healthcare, mylan and chai worked to bring respective expertise to develop a taste masked and dispersible product that was deemed of high clinical significance. in 2013, the who highlighted abc/3tc as a key medicine for the treatment of infants and children. viiv healthcare conducted the technical development of the product and provided finance and project management support for mylan to develop and file the product. mylan filed the product with the fda in october 2013.; recognising that 66% of the over 3 million children living with hiv worldwide do not have access to appropriate care and medicines, viiv healthcare has granted royalty-free voluntary licences for paediatric formulations of its existing and pipeline hiv medicines (including dolutegravir), in order to ensure that children in all least-developed, all low-income, and all sub-saharan african countries (where 99% of all children with hiv live) are able to receive high-quality, low-cost medicines.;

the partnership has also helped:;","in 2007, 85% of people in ampath’s catchment area of then 1.8 million people did not know their hiv status. in remote areas programs needed to find less expensive and more effective means of keeping those who were hiv-positive from progressing to advanced disease and death as well as work “upstream” to provide intervention before hiv-positive patients became gravely ill. testing people before they are obviously ill—and before they have infected their partners—will move more infected people into treatment earlier, when the treatment can be most effective and prevent thousands of people from becoming hiv-positive in the first place. the unaids “90-90-90” strategy (i.e. >90% of those with hiv found; >90% on art; >90% with viral suppression) requires a shift to a rapid testing strategy where counselors can cover targeted, high prevalence communities within months rather than years, testing and finding all hiv positive individuals as soon as possible.; additionally, to better meet the health needs of people in their catchment area, ampath has been transforming its hiv care system into an integrated health care system inclusive of the treatment and control of hiv but also addressing issues of maternal, newborn, and child health as well as chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:; ampath has developed a perpetual home-based counseling and testing (phct) program which allows phct counselors to offer door-to-door counseling and testing and linkage to care and treatment. the model reduces loss to follow up, leads to less expensive, more effective treatment and reduces the level of community viral load to markedly diminish hiv transmission within the community. with phct, ampath has better knowledge of hiv prevalence, can monitor the impact of its interventions, help reduce the loss to follow up and can ensure care and treatment for the long term.  the use of simple technologies including solar power and cell phones with gps systems brings health care directly to people’s homes rather than requiring them to go to a hospital or clinic – often a hardship for those without access to transportation. ampath brought africa’s first operational model of care structured to halt the hiv pandemic comprehensively. evidence underlines that aggressive efforts to find, link, treat and retain (fltr) all hiv-infected persons in a population holds the promise of lowering the prevalence of hiv/aids substantially.; as of 2016 the partnership has reached over 1,500,000 people.  the percentage of individuals already in care among those who know their hiv status increased from 93.8% in 2014 to 99.3% in 2016.; phct counselors can also screen for tuberculosis, test for diabetes and blood pressure, treat children for intestinal worms, screen for cervical cancer, provide nutritional counseling and record household data in a handheld device which is then synced with the ampath electronic medical records system (amrs), linking patients to care.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; pfizer’s antimicrobial testing leadership and surveillance (atlas) program (formerly test) has monitored changing bacterial resistance patterns for over 13 years across more than 60 countries.   it provides physicians and the healthcare community with cumulative data on bacterial surveillance.  data from this effort have been reported in manuscripts and congress abstracts.    these cumulative data are also accessible through a publicly available web site (www.atlas-surveillance.com) that offers an interactive platform to enable physicians to evaluate data, conduct analyses, and export tables and figures corresponding to specific countries and regions, and customized by pathogen(s) and antibiotic(s). the atlas database is updated every 6 months with emerging data from over 200 institutions around the world.  atlas access is also available through a mobile app to enable data access at the point of care.; the leader program, established in 2004, is a national (us) initiative to monitor the activity of linezolid and comparator agents against target gram-positive pathogens.; the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, which began in 1997 and is managed by jmi laboratories, was designed to monitor the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections globally.  each year, the program surveys over 30,000 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms from medical centers participating in the global study.; the test program was established in 2004 and is a global program that tracks antibiotic resistance for both zyvox and tygacil antibiotics as well as other antibiotics. the scope of the test program (2004-2016) has reached 2,700 sites in 69 countries (cumulative total) since inception. currently, the program holds 200 active sites in 52 countries. since 2004, the test program has provided valuable data and information – generating over 360 posters and 57 peer reviewed manuscripts to date. results are available on a web-based interactive platform that includes a dynamic database of “real-time” surveillance data; the global antifungal surveillance program determines the frequency of occurrence of resistance among fungal pathogens causing infections in hospitalized patients. this global program includes 62 participating medical centers in the sentry program, located in north america, latin america, europe, and the asia-pacific region.; china-based antibiotic resistance surveillance programs:  since 2005, chinet has investigated the anti-bacterial resistance and susceptibility rate of clinical isolates from major regions in china. it has accumulated around 600,000 isolates so far and will also expand its coverage to all regions in 2017.chifnet investigates the anti-fungal resistance and susceptibility rate from all the regions since 2009, with about 3,500 isolated collected per.;

description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; pink ribbon red ribbon (prrr) is an innovative partnership to leverage public and private investments in global health to combat cervical and breast cancer – two of the leading causes of cancer death in women - in developing nations in sub-saharan africa and latin america.; pink ribbon red ribbon offers the hpv vaccination to pre-adolescent girls, which prevents most cases of cervical cancer. prrr supports country-led vaccination campaigns with vaccine donations, programmes, and resources for community education and outreach.; prrr supports its partners to screen women for breast cancer via clinical breast examinations, and provides screening for cervical cancer for women aged 30-49 years, particularly those living with hiv.; pink ribbon red ribbon’s partners implement the simple, inexpensive cervical pre-cancer “see-and-treat” screening approach. it involves visual inspection of the cervix with vinegar (acetic acid) to detect pre-cancerous lesions, followed soon or immediately afterward, when necessary, by ablative or electrosurgical (leep) treatment, as dictated by the woman’s needs. prrr is also helping test new molecular testing technologies that will help focus resources on women at highest risk of developing cancer.; in 2016, 316 652 women have been screened for cervical cancer, 119 192 girls have received all doses of the hpv vaccination and 22 039 women have been treated with cryotherapy or leep for cervical cancer.;

"326","Preparing for Pandemic Flu","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; influenza pandemics are rare but recurring events. they have typically occurred every 10-50 years throughout recorded history. the potentially serious impacts on human health, national economies and social infrastructure are of global concern. the last of three pandemics in the 20th century originated in hong kong in 1968-1969, causing around one million deaths. in june 2009 the who declared the 21st century’s first pandemic, which officially ended in august 2010.; with the ease and speed of travel, a localised epidemic can transform into a pandemic rapidly. hence, advance planning and preparedness are critical to help mitigate the impact. this includes stockpiling of essential antiviral medicines and vaccines.; tamiflu (oseltamivir) is on the front line of national pandemic defense strategies. the world health organization (who), the european centre for disease prevention & control (ecdc) and the us center for disease control and prevention (cdc) have stated that tamiflu is one of two approved antivirals with activity against the pandemic strain of h1n1 influenza virus.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; roche works closely with the who to maintain tamiflu stockpiles for distribution by the who to countries in need during a pandemic. the stockpiles can also be used for preventative measures to quickly contain and manage local outbreaks. roche also works with governments, private companies and other organisations to strengthen their global pandemic preparedness.; since 2005 roche has provided tamiflu capsules and active pharmaceutical ingredient to governments for use in the event of a pandemic at substantially reduced prices. low income countries can purchase tamiflu at further reduced prices (see pricing information on website). roche has also developed a pandemic preparedness plan, in association with the who and governments, that forms the basis of many company plans.; since some low-income countries are unable to create an adequate stockpile of tamiflu, even with reduced prices, in 2009 the company launched the tamiflu reserves program for member countries of the gavi alliance, excluding india. through the program roche offers tamiflu at further reduced prices and a spread payment over a number of years.; in 2005, roche granted sublicenses to three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, shanghai pharmaceuticals and hec group in china and hetero pharmaceuticals in india, to produce generic tamiflu (oseltamivir) for pandemic use in china, india and developing countries in case of a pandemic. in 2006, roche also provided information to a south african generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, aspen pharmaceuticals, to allow it to produce oseltamivir for pandemic use in africa.;

research. new technology is revolutionizing the way doctors can identify children with rhd. portable echocardiography machines create ultrasound images of the heart that can show tissue damage even before symptoms appear. using this new technology, over 3,000 schoolchildren in lusaka have been screened. children diagnosed with rhd are offered monthly penicillin injections according to national guidelines. the results of the screening will, for the first time, indicate the prevalence of rhd in a zambian population using echocardiography. ; health system strengthening. the partnership supports efforts of the local doctors and nurses to strengthen health systems in lusaka to help children with strep throat and rhd receive the treatment they need. currently, more than 25 government clinics in lusaka have been enrolled in this effort. all clinics completed an initial training workshop about rhd prevention and treatment and receive ongoing coaching by nurses from the university hospital. at the invitation of the health authorities in zambia, the partnership plans to extend the rollout of the rhd training and treatment effort from the initial lusaka scheme to multiple provinces across zambia. ; public awareness. public awareness is essential to rhd prevention and treatment. the partnership has distributed key messages through television and radio programs, and educational brochures and posters. many of these activities take place during a nationally sponsored “rhd week” each year. ; health policy. the partnership has contributed to health policy work to support rhd elimination throughout africa. partners helped to sponsor meetings of technical experts from more than 10 countries on three occasions under the auspices of the pan african society of cardiology, which ultimately helped seed an rhd policy roadmap developed by the african union and agreed upon by african ministers of health and heads of states. ; the initiative in zambia is coordinated by dr. john musuku, chief of paediatrics at university teaching hospital. the zambia ministry of health approves all programs that take place in government clinics. the partners meet in person or virtually 2-4 times monthly to discuss planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of program activities.;","novartis;","lusaka university;

the rbm partnership is the global framework for implementing coordinated action against malaria. it mobilizes resources for action and forges consensus among partners. the partnership is made up of more than 500 partners, including countries where malaria is endemic, their bilateral and multilateral development partners, the private sector, nongovernmental and community-based organizations, foundations, and research and academic institutions. the global malaria action plan defines two stages of malaria control: first, scaling-up for impact (sufi) of preventive and therapeutic interventions, and then sustaining control over time.; rbm’s strength lies in its ability to form effective partnerships both globally and nationally. partners work together to scale up malaria control efforts at country level, coordinating their activities to avoid duplication and fragmentation, and to ensure optimal use of resources. rbm’s strategy is to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by implementing activities in all countries where malaria is endemic and by strengthening health systems. ; glaxosmithkline remains an active member of the private sector delegation and is currently a board member representing the private sector. gsk is also active in various working groups including the malaria advocacy working group, the procurement & supply chain management working group and the gmap ll task force. gsk was involved in the launch of the progress and impact report on a decade of partnership and results.; novartis is an active member of the private sector delegation to the rbm board and held the board seat from may 2010-2012. today, novartis continues its strong involvement in three rbm partner committees: country/regional support partner committee, strategic communications partner committee, and advocacy and resource mobilization partner committee. in 2009, with rbm and other partners, novartis launched sms for life to help prevent stock-outs of antimalarials in tanzania.  sms for life has since been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in kenya, ghana, the democratic republic of congo and cameroon. over the years, the scope of the program has also expanded to more disease areas and health parameters. ; the malaria program is a flagship initiative of the sanofi access to medicines department. it reflects the organization’s long term commitment to use its core skills to build a sustainable and comprehensive model to fight malaria on all fronts, from prevention to treatment. sanofi and the drugs for neglected initiative (dndi) have developed an artemisinin combination therapy: asaq (artesunate amodiaquine) winthrop®. sanofi also helps its partners in the field through a comprehensive set of information education and communication tools and initiatives on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, which are tailored to the needs of all stakeholders in the healthcare chain.; lessons learned; the rbm partnership has demonstrated how a strong, well-organized multi-stakeholder partnership can help deliver broad health benefits while relieving overburdened health systems.; summary of impact and forward looking information; rbm has produced a series of progress and impact reports that comprehensively document progress in the fight against malaria.; according to the report entitled ‘a decade of partnership and results’, global malaria deaths have dropped by an estimated 38%, with 43 countries (11 of them in africa) cutting malaria cases or deaths by 50% or more, reversing the trend of the previous decade and saving over a million lives.;","glaxosmithkline;

"341","RTS,S Malaria Vaccine Candidate","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; development of vaccine to defend against p falciparum malaria parasite in children.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; malaria is endemic in over 100 countries. most infections occur in sub-saharan africa, south east asia and latin america; 90% of all malaria deaths occur in sub-saharan africa.; malaria transmitted by female members of the anopheles mosquito family, which feed on human blood. the initial symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscular pains and mild diarrhoea. infection can rapidly progress, leading to more severe symptoms, including delirium and convulsions, followed by coma and death.; people living in areas permanently affected by malaria can develop a partial immunity to the illness. in such individuals, infection leads to illness and inability to work or attend school, but it is less likely to prove fatal. young children do not yet have such partial immunity, while pregnant women lose immunity they had, leaving them vulnerable. this is why most malaria deaths are in children under five years and in pregnant women.; malaria continues to exact a heavy burden on the health and economies of communities across africa. economic research shows that malaria slows economic growth in africa by up to 1.3 per cent each year. malaria related illnesses and mortality cost africa’s economy alone us$12 billion per year.; malaria can be prevented by controlling the breeding of malaria carrying mosquitoes and sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets. it can be treated effectively too, using effective drugs at the correct dose for the right length of time. however, vaccines offer an economical and effective means of preventing diseases. closing the gap left by mosquito nets and treatments, particularly in the face of growing resistance to anti-malarials and insecticides, a vaccine against malaria could prove an essential tool in the fight against the disease. even a modestly efficacious malaria vaccine has the potential to protect hundreds of thousands from disease and death each year.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; for the past 30 years, gsk scientists have been working with others around the world to try to develop a vaccine against malaria. the rts,s malaria vaccine candidate is currently the most advanced in development globally. it was created in 1987 by scientists working at gsk’s laboratories with scientists from the walter reed army institute of research (wrair) and developed in partnership with path malaria vaccine initiative (mvi) since 2001, with grant monies from the bill & melinda gates foundation. if approved, the rts,s vaccine would be the first human vaccine against a parasite.; rts,s aims to trigger the body’s immune system to defend against the p. falciparum malaria parasite when it first enters the human host’s bloodstream and/or when the parasite infects liver cells. the vaccine is designed to prevent the parasite from infecting, maturing and multiplying in the liver, after which time the parasite would re-enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells, leading to disease symptoms.; rts,s is intended exclusively for use against the plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite, which is most prevalent in sub-saharan africa.; gsk has taken the lead in the overall development of rts,s and has invested more than $350 million to date and expects to invest a further $260 million until development is completed. with more than $200 million in grant monies from the bill & melinda gates foundation, the path malaria vaccine initiative (mvi) contributes financial, scientific, managerial, and field expertise to the development of rts,s. gsk has committed that the eventual price of rts,s will cover the cost of manufacturing the vaccine together with a small return of around 5% that will be reinvested in research and development for second-generation malaria vaccines, or vaccines against other neglected tropical diseases.; summary of impact and forward looking information; results from a large-scale phase iii trial presented in 2013 in durban demonstrated that rts,s helped to protect young children and infants from clinical malaria up to 18 months after vaccination. these results demonstrated that over 18 months of follow-up, rts,s almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children (aged 5-17 months at first vaccination) and to reduce by around a quarter the malaria cases in infants (aged 6-12 weeks at first vaccination). vaccine efficacy was also assessed separately at each of the trial sites, which represent a wide range of malaria transmission settings; efficacy was found to be statistically significant at all sites in young children and at four out of eleven sites in infants.; based on these data, gsk submitted in june 2014 a regulatory application to the european medicines agency (ema). the ema submission is the first step in the regulatory process toward making the rts,s vaccine candidate available as an addition to existing tools currently recommended for malaria prevention. an effective vaccine for use alongside other measures such as bednets and anti-malarial medicines would represent an advance in malaria control. if a positive scientific opinion from the ema is granted, the who has indicated a policy recommendation may be possible by end of 2015. ;

one in four people worldwide will be affected by a mental disorder at some point in their lives (4). mental disorders are a shattering experience, not only for the individual but also for his or her family. however in developing countries, the majority of patients receive no treatment (1). misunderstanding of the symptoms of these disorders, combined with traditional beliefs, contribute to patients being stigmatized. inadequate human and financial resources limit access to care. the shortage of psychiatrists, specialized nurses, psychologists and social workers, the lack of training of primary healthcare professionals are among the main barriers for patients to get access to care. the availability of essential medicines is particularly low and prices often high.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; since 2008, sanofi has initiated several programs in latin america, africa and asia, in partnership with local authorities, health professionals, patient associations and ngos. these programs combine training local health professionals, raising public awareness and fighting patients stigmatization. affordable medicines are also made available through preferential pricing policies. in the countries where sanofi implements programs, we design preferential pricing policies, to make our medicines accessible to the most disadvantaged patients, within the framework of relevant laws and procurement procedures.; initially launched in morocco and mauritania in collaboration with local authorities, health professionals, patient organizations and ngos, our programs have since been implemented in armenia, benin, madagascar and myanmar through the fight against stigma (fast) program, an innovative public-private partnership with the world association of social psychiatry (wasp). fighting the social stigma associated with mental illness is a key factor in access to healthcare and rehabilitation.; in addition to the fast program mental health initiatives have also been set up in the following countries: madagascar, mauritania, morocco, guatemala, comoros, india, south africa.; benin:  357 primary healthcare professionals and community health workers have been trained; madagascar: 144 primary healthcare workers have been trained and more than 500,000 people reached through awareness activities; mauritania: 127 healthcare professionals trained in schizophrenia morocco: 166 gps and nurses have been trained guatemala: in 2015, 82 health professionals were trained, 299 people with mental disorders managed and 1120 community members reached through behavior change communications initiatives. comoros: 106 healthcare workers (including 90 community health workers) have been trained. 124 people with schizophrenia are being managed.; armenia: 232 psychiatrists, general practitioners and nurses have been trained and 50,000 people have been reached through awareness initiatives.; india: scarf has developed a module to improve the rehabilitation of schizophrenia out-patients in india.;

latest 2011 sa national cancer registry (ncr) age standardized incidence rates for lung cancer are under-reported at 11/100,000 population, as the ncr is pathology-based relying on lung tissue biopsy specimens. the most important cause of lung cancer is tobacco smoking. large numbers of lung cancers related to asbestos and other occupational exposures (from mining), indoor biomass-fuel exposure and chronic inflammatory lung diseases – in particular tuberculosis also occur. with the successful scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (art), sa is facing an epidemic of non-communicable diseases (ncd’s) among aging people living with hiv/aids (aplwh). this population group is expected to triple by 2040 and the burden of copd and lung cancer will increase, highlighting the need for health system planning and for burden of disease research to inform health system responses.; lung cancer is the most common non-aids defining cancer among hiv-positive individuals with an incidence two to four fold higher than in hiv-negative patients, caused mainly by high prevalence of cigarette smoking among the hiv population. ;

artemisinin is a key ingredient in first-line malaria treatments recommended by the who. it is extracted from traditional chinese medical herb artemisia annua, but because it is extracted from plants, its supply can suffer from climatic variations, leading to unstable provision of antimalarial medicines and major price variations.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the partnership aims at developing a complementary, semisynthetic, source of artemisinin, to improve the availability of high-quality artemisinin derivatives to drug manufacturers and contribute to stabilizing the price of artemisinin-containing antimalarials to benefit patients and payers. the original idea and the proof of concept were developed at the university of california-berkeley, the project was then managed by the institute for one world health (iowh), a nonprofit pharmaceutical company. from the proof of concept, a first chemical route was developed on a laboratory scale by amyris biotechnologies, a us based biotech start-up. sanofi was selected as the manufacturing partner, due to the malaria program within its access to medicines department, and because of its production and technological competences and capacity. the bill & melinda gates foundation (bmgf) provided significant financial support to this project, from its inception to its latest stages.;

"365","SMS for Life","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; maintaining adequate supplies of medicines in health facilities in rural sub-saharan africa is a major barrier to the effective management of life-threatening diseases like malaria. lack of visibility of medicine stock levels at the health facility level is an important contributor to this problem. further, maternal mortality due to lack of access to blood stocks is a major problem. bringing online visibility to these stocks seeks to alleviate this problem. ; appropriate disease management (diagnosis and treatment) is a key part of any effective healthcare system. lack of timely data on patient numbers, confirmed diagnosis and treatment practices is a major obstacle to monitoring progress in disease management and to taking effective improvement measures.  ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:; led by novartis and supported by public and private partners, sms for life was initially launched in 2009 to help prevent stock-outs of antimalarials in tanzania. sms for life has since been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in kenya, ghana, the democratic republic of congo and cameroon. over the years, the scope of the program has also expanded to more disease areas and health parameters.; building on the success of sms for life, a new enhanced version, sms for life 2.0 was launched in 2016. ; how the system works:; the solution is based on the use of simple and affordable technologies (mobile phones, sms messages, smartphones and tablet computers, the internet and electronic mapping) so that health facilities that dispense essential medicines can report their stock levels and key disease surveillance indicators to the district medical officers who are responsible for treatment availability.; in addition to stock visibility, the system enables to collect timely and quality disease surveillance data, hence allowing all levels in the health pyramid (districts, regions, national malaria control programs, ministries of health) to monitor and support the operations in the primary health facilities – ultimately making fact-based decisions to better assess the adequacy of the resource allocation with the actual needs. stock-outs can thus be resolved in 2-3 days whereas in the past this would have taken one or two months.; the tablet-based platform also offers high-quality training programs and educational video resources to support the continuous education of health workers.; the data collected by sms for life can be integrated into a country’s health information system and strategy. implementation is tailored to the specific needs and priorities of individual countries, and the system is flexible, meaning it can be expanded to any number of health facilities, countries, programs, stock items or disease surveillance data.; to date, sms for life (phone-based version) has been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in tanzania, kenya, ghana, the democratic republic of congo and cameroon.; in tanzania, with support from medicines for malaria venture (mmv), the swiss agency for development and cooperation (sdc) and population services international (psi), sms for life was implemented in the country’s 5,100 health facilities. this project was also supported by the tanzania ministry of health and social welfare, ibm, google, vodafone and vodacom. tracking of tuberculosis and leprosy medicines, funded by the novartis foundation, has also been added.; in kenya, novartis supported the completion of an extensive pilot together with the national malaria control program (nmcp).; in ghana, following a successful pilot in six districts, sponsored by the swiss tph institute, we worked with the ghana health service on a full country scale-up. the system is also tracking 28 blood products from the national blood transfusion service and from 10 regional hospitals in the greater accra region. the online information on availability of blood products has helped reduce maternal mortality in child birth from hemorrhage.; the platform was rolled out in cameroon across more than 3,000 facilities to track malaria medicines and collect patient surveillance data in 2015.; in an initiative led by the president’s malaria initiative and rolled out by greenmash, sms for life was implemented in five provinces of the democratic republic of the congo (1,245 health facilities). further, the solution was also used to track bed nets, rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) and disease surveillance data, as well as antibiotics, medicines against leprosy and tuberculosis, and blood supplies.; sms for life has proven to work and be effective in both the multi-country pilots and country scale-ups where thousands of health facility workers have now been reporting their medicine stocks on a weekly basis for some years. bringing visibility to the stock levels on a weekly basis has proven to have a direct impact on better medicine stock management, reduction of stock-outs and a consequent increase in access to medicines at the remote health facility level. the main innovation and contribution of the program has been to design and develop an enterprise standard, in the form of a fully scalable, expandable and sustainable solution, which can be offered at an affordable price to resource-poor countries. the infrastructure, which has shown to work in the difficult target environment, now exists and is supported by at least three industry-leading technology suppliers the sms for life team has worked with.; sms for life 2.0:; building on the success of sms for life, a new enhanced version, sms for life 2.0 was launched in 2016 in kaduna state, nigeria’s third most populous region, together with the kaduna state ministry of health and vodacom. the new program addresses key operational challenges at peripheral healthcare facilities (dispensaries, health posts, healthcare and medical centers) in kaduna state.; using smartphones and tablet computers, local healthcare workers can track stock levels of essential antimalarials, vaccines, and hiv, tb and leprosy treatments, and send notifications to district medical officers when stock levels are low. tablet computers also allow for disease monitoring by supporting data collection of basic disease parameters in line with a country’s needs. the program also monitors surveillance parameters of malaria, maternal and infant deaths and seven other diseases, including measles, yellow fever and cholera. in addition, sms for life 2.0 enables training of healthcare workers in local facilities using on-demand elearning modules that support continuous education. these resources can also be used to increase public awareness on health topics.; in addition to the launch in nigeria, novartis and its non-profit partner right to care signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016 with the zambian ministry of health to deploy sms for life 2.0 in up to 2,000 health facilities across the country. the program, which will include stock reporting, disease surveillance and elearning, will be supported by vodacom and is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2017.; sms for life 2.0 is also under discussion in other sub-saharan countries. further, the system could be extended to treatments against noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes or high-blood pressure.;

building on the success of sms for life, a new enhanced version, sms for life 2.0 was launched in 2016. ; how the system works:; the solution is based on the use of simple and affordable technologies (mobile phones, sms messages, smartphones and tablet computers, the internet and electronic mapping) so that health facilities that dispense essential medicines can report their stock levels and key disease surveillance indicators to the district medical officers who are responsible for treatment availability.; in addition to stock visibility, the system enables to collect timely and quality disease surveillance data, hence allowing all levels in the health pyramid (districts, regions, national malaria control programs, ministries of health) to monitor and support the operations in the primary health facilities – ultimately making fact-based decisions to better assess the adequacy of the resource allocation with the actual needs. stock-outs can thus be resolved in 2-3 days whereas in the past this would have taken one or two months.; the tablet-based platform also offers high-quality training programs and educational video resources to support the continuous education of health workers.; the data collected by sms for life can be integrated into a country’s health information system and strategy. implementation is tailored to the specific needs and priorities of individual countries, and the system is flexible, meaning it can be expanded to any number of health facilities, countries, programs, stock items or disease surveillance data.; to date, sms for life (phone-based version) has been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in tanzania, kenya, ghana, the democratic republic of congo and cameroon.; in tanzania, with support from medicines for malaria venture (mmv), the swiss agency for development and cooperation (sdc) and population services international (psi), sms for life was implemented in the country’s 5,100 health facilities. this project was also supported by the tanzania ministry of health and social welfare, ibm, google, vodafone and vodacom. tracking of tuberculosis and leprosy medicines, funded by the novartis foundation, has also been added.; in kenya, novartis supported the completion of an extensive pilot together with the national malaria control program (nmcp).; in ghana, following a successful pilot in six districts, sponsored by the swiss tph institute, we worked with the ghana health service on a full country scale-up. the system is also tracking 28 blood products from the national blood transfusion service and from 10 regional hospitals in the greater accra region. the online information on availability of blood products has helped reduce maternal mortality in child birth from hemorrhage.; the platform was rolled out in cameroon across more than 3,000 facilities to track malaria medicines and collect patient surveillance data in 2015.; in an initiative led by the president’s malaria initiative and rolled out by greenmash, sms for life was implemented in five provinces of the democratic republic of the congo (1,245 health facilities). further, the solution was also used to track bed nets, rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) and disease surveillance data, as well as antibiotics, medicines against leprosy and tuberculosis, and blood supplies.; sms for life has proven to work and be effective in both the multi-country pilots and country scale-ups where thousands of health facility workers have now been reporting their medicine stocks on a weekly basis for some years. bringing visibility to the stock levels on a weekly basis has proven to have a direct impact on better medicine stock management, reduction of stock-outs and a consequent increase in access to medicines at the remote health facility level. the main innovation and contribution of the program has been to design and develop an enterprise standard, in the form of a fully scalable, expandable and sustainable solution, which can be offered at an affordable price to resource-poor countries. the infrastructure, which has shown to work in the difficult target environment, now exists and is supported by at least three industry-leading technology suppliers the sms for life team has worked with.; sms for life 2.0:; building on the success of sms for life, a new enhanced version, sms for life 2.0 was launched in 2016 in kaduna state, nigeria’s third most populous region, together with the kaduna state ministry of health and vodacom. the new program addresses key operational challenges at peripheral healthcare facilities (dispensaries, health posts, healthcare and medical centers) in kaduna state.; using smartphones and tablet computers, local healthcare workers can track stock levels of essential antimalarials, vaccines, and hiv, tb and leprosy treatments, and send notifications to district medical officers when stock levels are low. tablet computers also allow for disease monitoring by supporting data collection of basic disease parameters in line with a country’s needs. the program also monitors surveillance parameters of malaria, maternal and infant deaths and seven other diseases, including measles, yellow fever and cholera. in addition, sms for life 2.0 enables training of healthcare workers in local facilities using on-demand elearning modules that support continuous education. these resources can also be used to increase public awareness on health topics.; in addition to the launch in nigeria, novartis and its non-profit partner right to care signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016 with the zambian ministry of health to deploy sms for life 2.0 in up to 2,000 health facilities across the country. the program, which will include stock reporting, disease surveillance and elearning, will be supported by vodacom and is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2017.; sms for life 2.0 is also under discussion in other sub-saharan countries. further, the system could be extended to treatments against noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes or high-blood pressure.;","maintaining adequate supplies of medicines in health facilities in rural sub-saharan africa is a major barrier to the effective management of life-threatening diseases like malaria. lack of visibility of medicine stock levels at the health facility level is an important contributor to this problem. further, maternal mortality due to lack of access to blood stocks is a major problem. bringing online visibility to these stocks seeks to alleviate this problem. ;

the funds raised have helped to implement and support the running and equipping of much needed orphan centres by ecpp where children are given food, clothing, practical skills training and the chance of a secondary school education. the children also receive training in skills such as tin-smithing, carpentry and knitting. local community leaders and villagers are trained to competently manage these centres by ecpp, encouraging self-reliance amongst the communities we help. ; a further share of the funds are used by unicef to support primary education by building classrooms, improving facilities and providing learning materials.  roche is also supporting unicef to build a teachers training college that will house more than 500 new local teachers by 2017, helping future generations in malawi benefit from an education.; roche’s support aims to encourage self-sustainability by helping local communities develop the skills and knowledge which will improve their lives today, and for future generations to come.  education, along with proper nutrition and health, are the pillars of a sustainable society and critical necessities in developing countries.; summary of impact and forward looking information; since 2003, five orphan centers in malawi have been equipped and 17,000 orphan children in malawi have been supported. furthermore, the funds have been able to:; as local affiliates can use up to 50% of the raised donations for local children projects, over 90 additional local organisations are supported all around the world, including foundations, charities, hospitals, children’s homes, schools, hospices and orphanages. ; by continuing to support these projects through this annual fundraising event, roche aims to make permanent sustainable change for vulnerable children in malawi, and other countries around the world. ;","roche;","european coalition of positive people (ecpp);

"384","Tackling TB in Central Asia and Africa","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; according to the red cross, tuberculosis (tb), a highly contagious disease, kills almost two million people each year. patient failure to complete long and complex tb treatment creates resistance to future treatment programs, and co-existence of tb and hiv form a potentially lethal combination, each speeding the other’s progress.; tb is the leading cause of death among people who are hiv positive. for those affected by tb and hiv, stigma, poverty and poor access to services are added problems that challenge the successful completion of tb treatment.; a significant problem in the treatment of tb is not the availability of effective medicines, but the fact that treatment regimens are long and complicated. this means that many patients give up the treatment once the symptoms are no longer apparent, but before the infection is fully treated. this can lead to relapse which makes drug resistance more likely. encouraging patients to finish their course of treatment is therefore critical.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the british red cross society and astrazeneca work together to provide community based programs that promote tb and tb/hiv awareness and education, encouraging people to seek early diagnosis, improve patient compliance, provide care in the home and address the stigma associated with the diseases. through these programs, red crescent nurses monitor tb patients’ living conditions and health status through home visits and undertake refresher training on directly observed therapy (dot) strategy, psycho-social support and first aid tools.; the program offers motivation for sufferers to complete treatment by distributing hygiene parcels, recruiting former tb patients as support group leaders, who also help reduce associated stigma and encourage early diagnosis and involving former beneficiaries of the program in self-support groups and psychosocial counseling.;

the most popular vaccine used to treat tb was developed in the early 20th century using a bovine strain of the disease. despite widespread use, the vaccine does not always work. it has been shown to protect against severe tb in children, but there is little evidence of effectiveness in adults. furthermore, it can create a false-positive tb test in those who have been vaccinated.; to cure tb requires a regimen of several medicines that must be taken daily for six to nine months. but many patients fail to complete the treatment, or medication is incorrectly prescribed, which can lead to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr-tb).; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the battle against tb requires new, faster-acting medicines at affordable prices. the lilly tb drug discovery initiative, launched in june 2007, is a nonprofit public/private partnership focused on accelerating early-stage tb drug discovery. the initiative is run from a research facility in seattle, washington, and operates in partnership with the infectious disease research institute, msd, and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, which is part of the u.s. national institutes of health. bringing together specialists from around the world for the systematic exploration of vast, private molecular libraries, the initiative has a primary goal of filling the pipeline with new clinical candidates for future tb drug development.; lilly donated usd 15 million to launch the effort and has opened our library of more than 500,000 existing molecular compounds to test for possible tb treatments, including more effective treatments for drug-resistant strains. in 2008, the initiative announced its first acquisition of compounds for further development into drug candidates.; in november 2011, lilly announced that it is providing more than usd 4 million in additional funding to the infectious disease research institute. the funding will allow idri to continue its early phase drug discovery efforts focused on identifying new and better therapies in the fight against tuberculosis, including multi-drug resistant strains known as mdr-tb. in addition, lilly will provide more than usd 1 million in-kind for volunteer time from lilly scientists and access to the company's drug discovery expertise, chemical libraries, and research tools.;

"396","The ACTION Study: Understanding the impact of cancer in Southeast Asia","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES ; ; ; ; ;NEEDS ; more than 75% of people with cancer in southeast asian countries experience death or financial catastrophe within a year of diagnosis. treatments are costly and the disease significantly impairs people’s ability to work, resulting in economic hardship that can, in turn, have a devastating impact on cancer outcomes. ; but cancer care is not a high priority in asean countries, and only a few governments identify cancer as an impediment to economic growth. with little evidence available to articulate the economic impact of cancer on low and middle income households, and its relationship to treatment and health outcomes, a profound lack of understanding surrounds the burden of the disease. ; and yet it is a burden that is growing. it is estimated that there were over 770,000 new cases of cancer and 527,000 cancer deaths in the region in 2012. the number of new cases is expected to rise by around 70% by 2030, to reach 1.3 million.; roche wanted to quantify the true cost of cancer, and improve understanding of its impact. providing evidence would be a crucial step in supporting countries in the region to identify where investment can be targeted most effectively to reduce the burden the disease represents.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the action study (asean costs in oncology) was the largest study ever conducted in the region. led by the george institute for global health and supported by roche, it was the first of its kind to examine the human cost of cancer to populations across eight countries in southeast asia: cambodia, indonesia, laos, malaysia, myanmar, the philippines, thailand and vietnam.; the study was designed to assess the impact of cancer on household economic wellbeing, as well as patient survival and quality of life. it would also provide evidence to help countries in the region make decisions that would improve access to cancer care and provide adequate financial protection from the burden of costs associated with the illness.; the longitudinal cohort study followed 9,513 cancer patients through their first year following diagnosis. it represented a broad, partly working-age population with a mean age of 52 years, and involved a mix of public and private hospitals.; key activities were planned around the publication of the report’s findings in august 2015. these included a keynote presentation at a regional conference, roundtables with senior health advisors from the asean countries, and patient association events. all eight countries were represented at every event.; summary of impact and forward looking information; the data generated by the action study improved understanding of the challenges faced by cancer patients in southeast asia, and provided a factual basis for decisions around cancer services by policy-makers in the region.; in malaysia, patient organisation together against cancer (tac), used the study results to appeal for cancer drugs to receive an exemption from goods and services tax (gst). their efforts were successful. there was also a 33% increase in allocation for radiotherapy and oncology services.; in indonesia, local evidence was instrumental to the creation of new cancer treatment guidelines. moreover, a large stakeholder forum highlighting the action study contributed to had a positive impact on reimbursement decisions for herceptin and other cancer drugs in 2016.; similar initiatives are now underway in the middle east and latam regions, in collaboration with the harvard t.h. chan school of public health and the economist intelligence unit respectively.; measurement of progress towards objectives ; the action study provided a rigorous, scientific and detailed assessment of the impact of cancer on patients in southeast asia. offering the first evidence of its kind to quantify the burden of cost the illness can represent, the study proved to be a vital tool for health advisors and policy makers; XXX","XXX; COMPANY; roche; PARTNER; george institute for global health; PARTYPE; academia /  hospitals; FOCUS; non-communicable diseases; DISEASE; cancer; PROGTYPE; prevention programs - awareness & outreach; REGION; east asia & pacific; CNUMBER; COUNTRY; cambodia; indonesia; lao pdr; malaysia; myanmar; philippines; thailand; vietnam; START; 2015; ANTICIPATED; ongoing; XXX",NA,NA,"roche;","george institute for global health;","academia /  hospitals;","non-communicable diseases;","cancer;","prevention programs - awareness & outreach;",NA,"east asia & pacific;","COUNTRY; cambodia; indonesia; lao pdr; malaysia; myanmar; philippines; thailand; vietnam;","cambodia; indonesia; lao pdr; malaysia; myanmar; philippines; thailand; vietnam;",NA,"2015;","ongoing;",NA,"http://partnerships.ifpma.org/partnership/the-action-study-understanding-the-impact-of-cancer-in-southeast-asia"
"397","The London Declaration on NTDs","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; to eradicate, eliminate, or control 10 ntds by 2020, including:; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; neglected tropical diseases (ntds) are a group of 17 diseases that disproportionally impact those living in poverty. more than 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by ntds, including more than 500 million children. the opportunity exists to help millions of people avoid significant debilitation and disability, including malnutrition, disfigurement and social discrimination.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; many ntds can be controlled through existing, affordable interventions and tremendous progress has been made in recent years.; consistent with the london declaration on neglected tropical diseases (january 2012), the public and private partners will seek by 2020 to help eradicate guinea worm disease, help eliminate lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), leprosy, sleeping sickness (human african trypanosomiasis) and blinding trachoma and river blindness (in latin america, yemen and selected countries in africa), and help control schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthes, chagas disease (american trypanosomiasis) and visceral leishmaniasis.; to achieve this, original endorsers of the london declaration, including twelve pharmaceutical companies, the world health organization, governments of the united states and united kingdom, drugs for neglected diseases initiative, the bill and melinda gates foundation and the world bank, among others, work cooperatively to sustain or expand existing drug donation programs to meet demand through 2020. these partners share their expertise and compounds to accelerate research and development of new drugs and provide more than usd 785 million to support r&d efforts and strengthen drug distribution and implementation programs.; the partners also seek to advance r&d for many of these diseases through partnerships and by providing funding to find next-generation treatments and interventions for neglected tropical diseases (ntds). they enhance collaboration and coordination on ntds at national and international levels through public and private multilateral organizations to work more efficiently and effectively together. partners ensure endemic countries have the funding necessary to implement ntd programs that will help achieve these goals, supported by strong and committed health systems at the national level.; these are the five big commitments made in the london declaration:; by providing access to existing drugs and accelerating development of new treatments, millions of people can have a better opportunity to succeed in school and lead a more socially and economically productive lives.; the partners provide regular updates about their progress in reaching the 2020 goals and identify remaining gaps.; summary of impact and forward looking information; in 2015, pharmaceutical companies donated an estimated 2.4 billion tablets, enough for 1.5 billion treatments to prevent and treat ntds – an increase of 11.7% from 2014. an unprecedented 1.1 billion treatments were delivered to 858 million individuals in 2014. between 2012 and 2014, the number of people who needed treatment decreased by 230 million. since the london declaration, there have been over 7.9 billion tablets in pharma donations, which is enough for 5 billion treatments.; thus, one of the largest public health programs in the world owes its success to a drug donation program on a truly global scale. the generous contributions of pharmaceutical partners ensure that preventive chemotherapy programs for ntds are highly cost-effective, ranking them as one of the best buys in global development.; furthermore, the number of people who needed treatment for lymphatic filariasis (lf) decreased by 230 million between 2012 and 2014. thanks to the global trachoma mapping project (gtmp) there have been examinations of over 2.6 million people in 29 countries, representing a total of 224 million people. 18 of 73 countries endemic for lf and 8 of 58 countries endemic for trachoma have stopped mass drug administration (mda) and are under post-mda surveillance; an additional 22 countries are on track to achieve elimination of lf as a public health problem by 2020. four of six endemic countries in the americas have met the 2015 target of elimination of onchocerciasis, the disease remaining only in hard-to-reach yanomami communities on the border between brazil and venezuela. the program in africa is the only program to successfully achieve its coverage target.; merck doubled its donation from 100 million tablets in 2015 to 200 million in 2016. to date, more than 100 million patients have been treated, consisting primarily of children. merck and astellas are part of a public-private partnership to help develop an effective pediatric formulation of praziquantel to treat children under six years old, an age group which accounts for around 10% of the global population infected or at risk for schistosomiasis.; through participation in the london declaration bristol-myers squibb extended the reach of its r&d efforts into ntds, providing access to proprietary compound libraries to third parties, including drugs for neglected diseases initiative (dndi), to help develop potential new medicines for targeted ntds. bms further extended its collaboration with dndi on chagas and leishmaniasis and to identify potential clinical stage compounds with activity against helminthes. furthermore, at the institut pasteur korea, thousands of compounds from the bristol-myers squibb library were screened and over 100 compounds were identified with potential activity against chagas disease and visceral leishmaniasis. initial screening at the university of dundee identified 119 compounds with potential activity against visceral leishmaniasis.; in 2014 bayer and the drugs for neglected diseases initiative (dndi) started a product development partnership on the active ingredient emodepside to develop a new oral drug to treat river blindness. emodepside originates from the japanese pharmaceutical company astellas and has been developed by bayer’s animal health division for veterinary use. the compound has been found to be effective in killing adult worms in pre-clinical studies, thus showing potential as a new ‘macrofilaricidal’ drug for the treatment of patients with river blindness. a current bayer study  on the compound nifurtimox is to develop an appropriate, weight-adjusted dosing for newborn babies and children. the study, which involves pediatric patients including newborn babies, also aims to provide evidence for a shorter treatment duration. ; sanofi contributes to the fight against neglected tropical diseases, particularly within the scope of a long-term partnership with the who. launched in 2001 with a program focused on sleeping sickness, their partnership was extended to include leishmaniasis, buruli ulcer, yaws and chagas disease. since then, over 27 million people living in endemic areas in sub-saharna africa have been screened for sleeping sickness, and more than 175,000 people have received free treatment.  in partnership with the drugs for neglected diseases initiative (dndi), sanofi is working to develop a new oral treatment and novartis is engaged in drug discovery to identify improved oral treatment that could support disease elimination efforts.; bayer develops a new formulation of nifurtimox to allow weight-adjusted doses in children of all age groups suffering from chagas disease. the study in pediatric patients including newborn babies also aims to provide evidence for shorter treatment duration.; donated drugs from pharma companies are essential to achieving the goals of control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (ntds). glaxosmithkline and johnson & johnson founded the ntd supply chain forum (ntdscf) in october 2012 with the goal of identifying and addressing impediments to ntd drug delivery. the forum’s over-arching purpose is to streamline and coordinate the provision of donated drugs/supplies for country ntd programs. it is an excellent example of collaboration between companies, the who and the gates foundation in support of commitments made as part of the london declaration.; the ntdscf was initiated by a coalition of ntd drug supply chain partners led by gsk, and currently includes eisai, janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson, pfizer, msd*, merck, sanofi, who, the bill & melinda gates foundation, as well as freight forwarder dhl and supporting ngos (children without worms, international trachoma initiative, mectizan donation program and rti international).; the forum initially focused on delivery of ntd drugs from the manufacturer to the endemic countries (the ‘first mile’) primarily focused on the preventative chemotherapy diseases that rely on mda where drugs are frequently co-administered. more recently, it expanded its remit to assess possible in-country supply chain management and distribution areas where further support may be required (the ‘last mile’).;

in 2014 bayer and the drugs for neglected diseases initiative (dndi) started a product development partnership on the active ingredient emodepside to develop a new oral drug to treat river blindness. emodepside originates from the japanese pharmaceutical company astellas and has been developed by bayer’s animal health division for veterinary use. the compound has been found to be effective in killing adult worms in pre-clinical studies, thus showing potential as a new ‘macrofilaricidal’ drug for the treatment of patients with river blindness. a current bayer study  on the compound nifurtimox is to develop an appropriate, weight-adjusted dosing for newborn babies and children. the study, which involves pediatric patients including newborn babies, also aims to provide evidence for a shorter treatment duration. ; sanofi contributes to the fight against neglected tropical diseases, particularly within the scope of a long-term partnership with the who. launched in 2001 with a program focused on sleeping sickness, their partnership was extended to include leishmaniasis, buruli ulcer, yaws and chagas disease. since then, over 27 million people living in endemic areas in sub-saharna africa have been screened for sleeping sickness, and more than 175,000 people have received free treatment.  in partnership with the drugs for neglected diseases initiative (dndi), sanofi is working to develop a new oral treatment and novartis is engaged in drug discovery to identify improved oral treatment that could support disease elimination efforts.; bayer develops a new formulation of nifurtimox to allow weight-adjusted doses in children of all age groups suffering from chagas disease. the study in pediatric patients including newborn babies also aims to provide evidence for shorter treatment duration.; donated drugs from pharma companies are essential to achieving the goals of control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (ntds). glaxosmithkline and johnson & johnson founded the ntd supply chain forum (ntdscf) in october 2012 with the goal of identifying and addressing impediments to ntd drug delivery. the forum’s over-arching purpose is to streamline and coordinate the provision of donated drugs/supplies for country ntd programs. it is an excellent example of collaboration between companies, the who and the gates foundation in support of commitments made as part of the london declaration.; the ntdscf was initiated by a coalition of ntd drug supply chain partners led by gsk, and currently includes eisai, janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson, pfizer, msd*, merck, sanofi, who, the bill & melinda gates foundation, as well as freight forwarder dhl and supporting ngos (children without worms, international trachoma initiative, mectizan donation program and rti international).; the forum initially focused on delivery of ntd drugs from the manufacturer to the endemic countries (the ‘first mile’) primarily focused on the preventative chemotherapy diseases that rely on mda where drugs are frequently co-administered. more recently, it expanded its remit to assess possible in-country supply chain management and distribution areas where further support may be required (the ‘last mile’).;

"398","Tobacco-Free Youth Campaign","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES  ; tobacco-free youth campaign with toplum gönüllüleri vakfi (tog) in turkey to increase the level of awareness and to prevent smoking among young people.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; the tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced. it kills nearly six million people a year. approximately one person dies every six seconds due to tobacco and this accounts for one in 10 adult deaths. up to half of current users will eventually die of a tobacco-related disease.; among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most want to quit. counselling and medication can more than double the chance that a smoker who tries to quit will succeed. national comprehensive health-care services supporting cessation are available in only 19 countries, representing 14% of the world's population. there is no cessation assistance in 28% of low-income countries and 7% of middle-income countries. mass media campaigns can also reduce tobacco consumption, by influencing people to protect non-smokers and convincing youths to stop using tobacco.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; for 15-25 year olds to learn for themselves about the effects and impact of smoking and to adopt healthy behaviours, via a high quality training programme and activities.; through the use of participatory training sessions and social media communications designed to appeal to 15-25 year olds, the goal is to help them to learn for themselves about the effects and impact of  smoking and to adopt healthy behaviours. because people are most likely to begin to use tobacco as adolescents, it is especially important to inform young people about the harms of tobacco use before they start. health warnings can be conveyed using many different methods, including warning labels on tobacco packaging and anti-tobacco mass media campaigns.; this project complements turkish moh’s smoking cessation campaign, targetting 13,500 young people through the use of a wide range of communications tools and education training sessions. ; a pool of young people has been recruited from within the tog network of schools and universities to act as ambassadors and peer educators for the anti-tobacco campaign. this approach follows the aim of positioning youth as spokespersons for an anti-tobacco campaign, the social media campaign will also encourage young people to become anti-tobacco bloggers.; research shows that anti-smoking information should be prepared and presented in ways that address the needs of young people, and the reasons they smoke, rather than to persuade by attempts to scare.; lessons learned          ; reducing the prevalence of tobacco use cannot be made without strong political will and governmental commitment to adopt and implement robust tobacco control policies.; in this work, countries have a powerful tool in the who framework convention on tobacco control. in 2005, turkey became a party to the convention, and in 2009 turkey became the third country in europe to go 100 per cent smoke free, following the united kingdom and ireland.; proven measures to reduce tobacco use include mandatory health warning labels on tobacco packaging and hard-hitting mass media campaigns that show the harms of tobacco use. correspondingly, the ministry of health’s anti-tobacco campaign was published on tv, via the internet, and on print ads warning people of the dangers of cigarettes by emphasizing the suffering that smoking causes. a call center, “alo 171,” was also started to help people quit smoking.; broad educational efforts that reach all age groups are considered more effective in influencing youth behaviour than efforts targeted specifically at them from an adult perspective, hence the adoption of the peer educators’ approach of learning via participatory workshops that are fun and relevant to young adults.  ;

2. creation of a health care workforce that forms the nidus of such intervention and can serve as a model to be replicated in subsequent national public sector initiative – if found useful.; 3. to carry out operational research in the interface of diabetes and liver diseases – that can serve as a template for planning future interventions in the community as well as clinic based care.; 4. development of an overall scientific and perceptual environment that facilitate action and care in metabolic diseases as an integrated entity.; overall the aim of this research project is the assessment of the prevalence of diabetes in the rural area, promotion of metabolic health and assessment of liver disease in relation to diabetes.; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; the frequency of liver disease in diabetics is high. nafld, of varying stage, is present in nearly one-third of diabetics and more so, when obese. nafld contributes to morbidity of diabetics, increases the need for clinical care and hospitalizations and predisposes diabetics to the development of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and strokes. apart from nafld, prevalence of hepatitis c amongst diabetics is also higher than amongst non-diabetics. outcome of liver disease worsens with diabetes and diabetes is a factor for faster progression of liver disease of any etiology, including adversely influences on treatment outcomes in hepatitis c. diabetics also develop hepatocellular carcinoma more frequently than non-diabetics. all these highlight the need for tight diabetic control and an integrated approach targeting metabolic homeostasis in diabetes patients.; in the light of the above, development of a “metabolic health port” that acts, fosters and disseminates necessary information seems to be a viable and sustainable initiative for a concerted action in metabolic health.; non-communicable diseases (ncds) contribute nearly half of all deaths in india and significant morbidity and disability. prevalence of ncds is also increasing in rural india. as ‘the risk factors of today are the diseases of tomorrow’, therefore identification of such factors and periodical assessment are very important to prevent ncds at the present time.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; the project envisages the following components:; an awareness and action component; central of which is the creation of “metabolic ports” that provide integrated function in metabolic diseases namely – diabetes, liver disease and hypertension.; the projects implement community level awareness and screening for diabetes, blood pressure and liver disease – as critical, interrelated metabolic health determinants. each port is staffed with trained rural health care providers (rhcp) (in rural areas) and by other category of health providers – suitably trained - in urban areas.  since the vast majority of people live in rural areas, the primary focus is the rural habitations. each peripheral metabolic is equipped with a glucometer, blood pressure equipment, a weighing machine and informative tools for awareness generation. we have screened 125,000 individuals by november 2016. ; an operational research component; 1. an appraisal of the “perception” of people and providers guides this intervention as a flagship: this first part is to have an appraisal of the existing perception, knowledge and practice amongst the people as well as the providers of different category – both formal and informal – regarding the metabolic diseases, focusing on diabetes and liver disease.; 2. a clinic based multi centric research is undertaken to investigate the intricate relationship between diabetes and liver disease. the aims of this research are to capture the ways that diabetes and liver disease interfere in each other’s natural history, in the short term.; two groups of patients will be included in the documentation and short term follow up study:; summary of impact and forward looking information;  1. increased awareness amongst people in metabolic health as an integrated platform.; 2. improved detection of diabetes, hypertension and abnormal liver tests amongst asymptomatic people – who otherwise would have gone undetected /detected late in the course of life. this would create a permissive motivational situation for the need of intervention in “asymptomatic metabolic ill health” at the individual and community level.; 3. encouraging behaviour change to embrace a habit for regular monitoring in management of diabetes and hypertension in individuals as well as in the overall culture of the society.; 4. non pharmacological modalities in lifestyle diseases such as exercising, healthy cooking and eating is encouriaged.; 5. better possibility of integration of the rhcps and strengthening their role as an enriched clan of health worker in the mainstream health care delivery system.; 6. better understanding of the level of awareness amongst people and providers – finding out the key areas warranting attention in intervention.;

an operational research component; 1. an appraisal of the “perception” of people and providers guides this intervention as a flagship: this first part is to have an appraisal of the existing perception, knowledge and practice amongst the people as well as the providers of different category – both formal and informal – regarding the metabolic diseases, focusing on diabetes and liver disease.; 2. a clinic based multi centric research is undertaken to investigate the intricate relationship between diabetes and liver disease. the aims of this research are to capture the ways that diabetes and liver disease interfere in each other’s natural history, in the short term.; two groups of patients will be included in the documentation and short term follow up study:; summary of impact and forward looking information;  1. increased awareness amongst people in metabolic health as an integrated platform.; 2. improved detection of diabetes, hypertension and abnormal liver tests amongst asymptomatic people – who otherwise would have gone undetected /detected late in the course of life. this would create a permissive motivational situation for the need of intervention in “asymptomatic metabolic ill health” at the individual and community level.; 3. encouraging behaviour change to embrace a habit for regular monitoring in management of diabetes and hypertension in individuals as well as in the overall culture of the society.; 4. non pharmacological modalities in lifestyle diseases such as exercising, healthy cooking and eating is encouriaged.; 5. better possibility of integration of the rhcps and strengthening their role as an enriched clan of health worker in the mainstream health care delivery system.; 6. better understanding of the level of awareness amongst people and providers – finding out the key areas warranting attention in intervention.; 7. the “liver – diabetes interface” research will bring forth the critical operational issues in planning management of diabetes in liver disease – a common and evolving problem.;","the frequency of liver disease in diabetics is high. nafld, of varying stage, is present in nearly one-third of diabetics and more so, when obese. nafld contributes to morbidity of diabetics, increases the need for clinical care and hospitalizations and predisposes diabetics to the development of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and strokes. apart from nafld, prevalence of hepatitis c amongst diabetics is also higher than amongst non-diabetics. outcome of liver disease worsens with diabetes and diabetes is a factor for faster progression of liver disease of any etiology, including adversely influences on treatment outcomes in hepatitis c. diabetics also develop hepatocellular carcinoma more frequently than non-diabetics. all these highlight the need for tight diabetic control and an integrated approach targeting metabolic homeostasis in diabetes patients.; in the light of the above, development of a “metabolic health port” that acts, fosters and disseminates necessary information seems to be a viable and sustainable initiative for a concerted action in metabolic health.; non-communicable diseases (ncds) contribute nearly half of all deaths in india and significant morbidity and disability. prevalence of ncds is also increasing in rural india. as ‘the risk factors of today are the diseases of tomorrow’, therefore identification of such factors and periodical assessment are very important to prevent ncds at the present time.;

summary of impact and forward looking information; since the first train started its journey more than 20 years ago, the trains have touched the lives of approximately 12 million people, dispensed more than half a million pairs of spectacles and provided medication to over 650,000 people. since the trains’ inception, more than 15,000 volunteers have participated in a basic healthcare education programme, and over three million people have participated in hiv/aids and first aid training. on average, the phelophepa i and phelophepa ii trains reach more than 375,000 people a year and serves as a training opportunity for student doctors and nurses and job opportunity for hundreds of unemployed or retired health professionals. ;","in rural communities in resource-limited countries where there is usually a very poor doctor-to-patient ratio, people travel long distances to receive even basic healthcare provision. the transnet-phelophepa train aims to address this challenge by travelling to up to 70 remote communities per year to bring healthcare services directly to the patients.; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; transnet-phelophepa is a free, mobile healthcare clinic that travels to areas of rural south africa, where there is just one doctor for every 5,000 patients. phelophepa is owned and operated by transnet foundation with roche being phelophepa’s main external sponsor, providing funding since the train took its first journey in 1994.; there are two trains (phelophepa i and phelophepa ii), each comprised of 18 coaches providing facilities to conduct general health, dental and eye checks in rural communities, and dispense treatments for diagnosed conditions. in addition to these general health services, individual counselling sessions and group workshops to help people cope with psychological issues such as stress and depression are offered.; the trains also house special coaches for education, where members of the local communities can participate in classes on general health issues such as nutrition, hygiene and dental health. more specialist services have been introduced, including diabetes prevention, hypertension and cancer screening, with free pap smears and prostate screening now being provided in a tent set up on the train’s platform at some stops.;

"414","Women's Cancer Initiative in the Americas","XXX; ; OBJECTIVES; ; ; ; ;NEEDS; cancer is the second leading cause of death in the americas, where an estimated 1.1 million people are newly diagnosed and 600,000 people die each year. breast and cervical cancer are among the most common cancers in women (approximately 43,000 women died from breast cancer in 2012). despite these diseases being highly amenable to early detection and cure, women continue to die prematurely, partly because of the limitations in access to cost-effective screening and treatment.; cancer registration is necessary for cancer control, as knowledge of the country’s particular cancer situation and patterns is needed to make informed decisions on the targeted interventions to reduce incidence and mortality. high-quality population based cancer registries (pbcr) at the national level are the ideal standard for cancer registration.  in latin america and the caribbean, these exist in only two countries (costa rica and uruguay), although there are regional cancer registries in many countries, as well as ongoing efforts to establish pbcr. ; description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges; for over 15 years, paho has supported the ministries of health of countries in latin america and the caribbean in the ramping up of their cancer prevention and treatment initiatives. in 2014, paho foundation and the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers and associations (ifpma) began a three year partnership to increase awareness of breast and cervical cancer and improve screening and earlier detection services to reduce the numbers of women who prematurely die from these cancers.; the first year of this partnership saw great progress in three main areas. first, raising awareness of breast and cervical cancer to encourage women to engage in screening and early detection services. in order to do this, the partnership produced a number of educational materials for the public on breast and cervical cancer prevention, detection and treatment. second, carrying out a pilot project with the ministry of health in chile to strengthen national cervical cancer screening programs as well as a series of policy workshops with government officials and health experts. third, holding a cancer registry training with relevant officials in 11 countries, in collaboration with the international agency for research on cancer (iarc) and hosted by the national cancer institute of argentina.;

work began with a wide-ranging diagnostic study involving almost 2,000 patients, to see how their hypertension was being managed. researchers conducted in-depth interviews with more than 500 patients to better understand how people themselves viewed their disease and its management.; the research findings enabled a novartis team to devise a comprehensive plan to address the root causes of poor blood pressure control in yaroslavl. clinical treatment guidelines were updated to align with national standards and these were sent to all clinics across the region. promotional materials and education sessions for healthcare practitioners spread information about the program.; after enrolling 500 doctors in nearly 40 clinics across the region, the program aimed to raise the awareness of thousands of patients through a public education campaign which used television advertising and a poster on municipal buildings, public transport and outdoor advertisements.; overall, the yaroslavl hypertension program aimed to persuade patients and healthcare practitioners to adapt their behaviors. specifically, it encouraged medical staff to routinely monitor patients’ blood pressure and educate people about the causes of high blood pressure such as adapting their diet and participating in regular exercise, reducing their consumption of alcohol and tobacco, and monitoring their own weight and blood pressure at home.; lessons learned                          ; patients and healthcare practitioners changed their behavior as result of a long-term process, which generally contributed to improve the patients’ health outcomes in the region. ; the yaroslavl program shows it is possible to address one enduring challenge in global health: even when the latest medicines and healthcare technology are available, people often fail to benefit. the reasons vary, but are often linked to the way doctors, nurses, patients and hospitals interact in their efforts to keep people healthy.; finding more effective ways to care for people is increasingly important at a time when  governments and payers in many parts of the world face a difficult challenge delivering better quality healthcare to more people who are living longer, all in a time of economic uncertainty. ;
