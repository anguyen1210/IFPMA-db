            What are the health needs and challenges?
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, are the leading cause of death and illness worldwide. Success in the fight against infectious diseases, and rising living standards and the changes in lifestyle that accompany – unhealthy diet, tobacco use, and so on – have led to a rising proportion of global deaths accounted for by NCDs. Traditionally seen as diseases of high-income countries, low-income and emerging countries now account for nearly 50% of the global NCD burden. Four types of NCDs – cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases – kill 3 in 5 people in the world, with 80 per cent of these occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 
NCDs are a growing health and economic challenge for both rich and poor countries.
It is estimated, however, that half of the deaths caused by NCDs are preventable. Prevention can be achieved through increased health literacy, awareness and simple behavioral changes aimed at reducing common risk factors. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Building on the IFRC’s long history of health promotion within communities by using simple tools adapted to local context, also known as the Community-based Health First Aid Manual (CBHFA), the IFRC-IFPMA '4 Healthy Habits' partnership develops and adds to the existing manual a module on healthy lifestyle guidelines and NCDs control and prevention.
In a bid to reduce risk factors from community members’ lifestyles, such as unhealthy diet, tobacco and physical inactivity, the module incorporates behavior change methods for different target groups (program managers, facilitators, volunteers and community members) to meet the needs of different age groups.
These tools are easy-to-use, interactive and available in three different languages. They are deployed for use by the 98 Red Cross Crescent National Societies worldwide and help Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers to empower their communities to do the required behavior changes for healthy lifestyle, focusing on the key necessary five steps: knowledge, approval, intention, practice and advocacy. Scoring tools are part of the guidelines to help the volunteers and community members to better understand their health status and get a targeted support. These scoring tools are available on paper-based, online and mHealth versions.
The IFRC will make the toolkit available to about 3 million people worldwide through a 15-million strong volunteer network in 189 countries. Volunteers in 20 countries in Asia and the Pacific and 13 countries in Europe, have already been trained and training is expected in a further 40 countries in the Americas and Africa by 2014. 
Lessons learned:
Fighting NCDs requires multi-stakeholders solutions. As a novel cross-sector collaboration responding to the United Nations call to tackle NCDs, the two-year partnership between the IFRC and IFPMA pools the expertise and resources of both partners in order to reach the highest impact possible at community level.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
The 98 Red Cross Crescent National Societies are implementing community based health and first aid programs with over 30,000 active volunteers at the community level reaching more than 2.8 million beneficiaries all over the globe.
The program has been successful in attracting a huge interest, with many countries having already started the implementation with the existing draft materials, such as Indonesia and Bangladesh. There are 4 regional trainings planned in 2014 and several country training will be taking place naturally. Due to this success, the number of target countries has been raised from 40 to 75, and a translation into 3 additional languages has been planned.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Delaying treatment or poor compliance can create serious complications such as retinopathy, kidney damage, neuron damage, foot ulcers and amputations. Without better prevention and treatment interventions, the cost of diabetes treatment will become enormous. 
Normally doctors only spend 6 hours with one diabetes patient a year. To manage disease in the rest of 8760 hours each year is a great challenge for diabetes patients. A comprehensive and integrated approach is requested to address this challenge. Increased awareness and access to treatment are not enough. People living with diabetes also need self-management support that can delay complications and improve the quality of their lives.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Trained 500 community doctors to improve their capacity and professional skills to better support diabetes patients in the community
Trained 500 peer leaders to enhance their understanding of diabetes knowledge and skills of how to motivate diabetes patients to change their behaviors, and framing interventions within a person-centered approach.  
Organize diabetes self-management camps engaging 50,000 diabetes patients and their family members to increase their ability for disease management
Promote the concept of 8760Hours Healthcare Action through publicity such as media coverage, paper publicity.
Develop the” Guideline of Healthcare Self-Management for People with Type 2 Diabetes in China” based on the field practice
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
1. Community health center knows how to support patients and peer leaders for diabetes management  2. Trained peer leaders are proactive to organize learning and sharing activities for better disease management  3. The diabetes treatment compliance rate was greatly enhanced

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Although the government of Benin has prioritized maternal, newborn and child health, rates of maternal and neonatal mortality are still high. There are about 1,500 preventable maternal deaths per year that are due to complications during pregnancy, childbirth and the 6-week period following childbirth. A national study conducted in 2010 found an absence of basic as well as comprehensive obstetric and neonatal emergency services in the Cove-Zagnanado-Ouinhi health zone.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In each of the 35 villages, a community volunteer will be appointed by the community to monitor pregnancies and women who have given birth, acting as the relay point between health centers and these women.
CARE will use mobile phone systems to build local capacity and healthcare networking. This is an innovation in Benin. Each of the 35 community volunteers will be responsible for the using mobile phones to:
Monitor pregnant women better before, during and after delivery, by recording data and transmitting them to health workers who can assess the health situation more effectively.
Inform and educate pregnant women by broadcasting specific information (e.g. via video etc.).
Contact and strengthen linkages among stakeholders in maternal and child health emergencies (e.g. phone calls to organize the transportation of women and children and their treatment in health centers).
The project plans to create a fund to support the reference/counter-reference system for beneficiaries. This fund will among other things enable communities to provide for a village motor tricycle ambulance or ambulance motorboat in an effort to overcome the remoteness of villages from health centers and district/or hospital area.
Due to the isolation of Ouinhi and its distance from health centers, this component is essential to the success of the project. The motor tricycle or motorboat ambulance will make it easier to evacuate pregnant women and children in emergencies to health centers using village routes. This will address the two major difficulties of distance and delays in administering first aid.
Lessons learned
For some long-term healthcare programs, such as “A Call for Life”, multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential. In additional to private partners, Care works with local partners, technical companies, and official government institutions, including the Department of Maternal and Child Health of the Ministry of Health, the Zou Departmental Health Agency, the Municipality of Ouinhi and regional hospital board.
 Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2013, 5,459 people (4,364 women and 1,095 newborns) received medical care and access to healthcare.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Africa accounts for approximately 90% of the total usage of LPV/r in donor-funded developing countries. The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) and AbbVie signed a new licensing agreement to help ensure sustainability of long-term supply of LPV/r, the most widely used second-line HIV treatment in South Africa and across Africa. Upon obtaining a sublicense from MPP, the agreement allows generic ARV manufacturers to manufacture and sell generic versions of LPV/r throughout Africa, as well as combinations of ritonavir with other ARVs, such as atazanavir and darunavir, as alternative second-line treatments.
The MPP will work to swiftly grant licences to generic manufacturers with stringent regulatory approval.  Those that have already received regulatory approval for these medicines in South Africa will be able to distribute in the country. The South African government will consider applications from other manufacturers that wish to seek approval under its fast track process. By doing so, it will aim to secure supply of the product as treatment needs increase, as well as to support the Ministry of Health in providing care for communities living with HIV.
The agreement  also allow global manufacturers to supply LPV/r and other ritonavir-based combinations to the whole African continent. While many African countries are currently able to purchase generic versions of these medicines from India, this license will enable manufacturers in other countries where there are patents, such as China and South Africa, to manufacture LPV/r and other ritonavir-based treatments, thus broadening the supplier base for the entire African continent.
The licence is royalty free and, as is the case for all MPP licences, is non-exclusive and published on the MPP website.  The agreement represents the second licence established between MPP and AbbVie. The first agreement was for paediatric formulations of LPV/r signed in December 2014. More information are available here.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Accelerating Access Initiative (AAI), begun in 2000, was a partnership between UNAIDS, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Bank and research-based pharmaceutical companies. Participants in AAI are committed to working with governments, international organizations and other stakeholders to find ways to broaden access, whilst ensuring rational, safe and effective use of medicines for HIV/AIDS.
The strong commitment of the AAI companies to improving access to treatment manifested itself in many innovative ways. All AAI companies had individual programs through which they provided their own antiretroviral medicines at more affordable prices in developing countries. Some AAI companies expanded manufacturing capacity to meet product demand in the developing world. Individual AAI companies also took other actions to increase the overall availability of ARVs, including the granting of voluntary licenses or non-assert declarations, contract manufacturing with generic manufacturers and technology transfer agreements. These efforts are delivered results:in September 2008, 773,803 patients in developing countries were estimated to be taking one or more medicines supplied at preferential prices by an AAI company. In addition, the number of patients in developing countries treated with generic ARVs - including those through cooperative efforts with AAI companies - increased significantly.
AAI partners recognize that expanded access to medications requires a collaborative approach with governments, NGOs, multilateral organizations, and other public and private bodies. Many AAI companies involved in initiatives to strengthen healthcare systems streamline product registrations and conduct clinical studies in developing countries. AAI companies also invested significantly in research and development of new medications - including pediatric formulations - and diagnostics, to help combat the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Access to healthcare and medicines, such as artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) for treatment of malaria, remains a challenge for many people in developing countries such as Tanzania.
Availability and affordability of safe and efficacious medicines are crucial factors impacting access, which in turn affects the ability to combat diseases, as well as child and maternal mortality.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development uses an access to healthcare framework, defining the degree to which a patient’s resources, needs and expectations (demand) are aligned with a healthcare system’s services and providers (supply). Access to healthcare can only be sustainable if the local healthcare system and services are aligned with well-informed demand. Based on this framework, ACCESS developed five interventions to improve access in a comprehensive way:
Assessing the quality of health services in health facilities and training health workers
Introducing the Rapid Diagnostic Test for malaria
Implementing social marketing campaigns to optimise appropriate demand for effective malaria treatment
Supporting women’s saving groups to empower women and improve their financial means, including for access to healthcare
Supporting Community Health Funds (CHF) to achieve better healthcare access and financial protection of the population.
ACCESS worked to make the quality assessment approach (currently paper-based) more manageable, viable and more efficient in terms of time, financial and human resources, and eventually to be scalable. To do this the Novartis Foundation collaborated with Vodafone in 2011 to develop an ICT-based version of the paper-based assessment tool called e-TIQH (electronic Tool to Improve the Quality of Healthcare).
Lessons learned
Supportive supervision is the single most influential factor on the final outcome of the program. The comprehensive access framework of activities operating integrated to the targeted malaria approach is also an essential element of the success of ACCESS.      
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
ACESS I ran from 2003-2007; ACCESS II from 2008 to 2011.
From 2004 to 2008, results show that the proportion of investigated fever cases treated with a recommended antimalarial within 24 hours increased from 66% to 89%, indicating earlier treatment-seeking behavior. The proportion of investigated fever cases treated with a recommended antimalarial within 24 hours in the correct dosage also improved from 43% to 63%.
Child mortality rates decreased by 42.5% from 14.6 c/1000py in 1997 to 8.4 c/1000py in 2009. All malaria control interventions, inclusive of the ACCESS program, were associated with decreases in child mortality.  (S.Alba et al., Int. J. Epidemiol.)
To ensure sustainability beyond ACCESS II, the team is working on integrating project components into district health plans, e.g. funds for conducting regular assessments of health services and for rewarding performance of health workers. Furthermore, the m-health-based performance assessment tool will facilitate effective supportive supervision managed by the district authorities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes and mental health disorders are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.  The issue of NCDs has reached a crisis point, particularly in low and middle-income countries where 80% of NCD-related deaths occur. Often, this is a result of barriers, such as a lack of trained healthcare professionals, that limit access to care. The fatality rate from NCDs is expected to nearly double by 2030, placing an even greater burden on communities and economies around the world already combating infectious diseases. The Access Accelerated initiative aims to tackle this burden.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Access Accelerated is a multi-stakeholder collaboration involving 22 biopharmaceutical companies working with partners to help overcome access barriers to NCD medicines in LMICs. Access Accelerated supports on-the-ground work to improve NCD prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
The initiative was launched at the World Economic Forum 2017 and will run as an initial three-year commitment to develop, measure and replicate sustainable programs in LMICs.  By building on long-standing individual company programs in global health, many of which feature on the IFPMA Directory, Access Accelerated will address a variety of access barriers to NCD prevention, treatment and care. With the help of independent experts at Boston University, the efforts made will be evaluated to establish a framework for progress and measure effectiveness.
Thanks to the support of partner World Bank Group, the initiative will also identify solutions to address financing, regulatory and service delivery barriers at country level.
In addition, Access Accelerated will set up partnerships with organizations specializing in major NCDs, starting with cancer. Cancer is a prime example of an NCD for which disease awareness, screening and early diagnosis are key to treatment. As part of this effort, a coalition of companies will be the founding partners of the UICC’s C/Can 2025. In 2017, C/Can 2025 will engage cities around the world to improve cancer treatment and care, working specifically with cities in LMICs which require international support to deliver effective, sustainable cancer care.

            What are the health need and challenges?
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are now the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and the poorest and most vulnerable are most affected by these largely preventable diseases.
Having access to medicines to combat NCDs is a key factor for improving health and development in communities. Diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes together, affect more than 1 billion people in LMICs.   
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Access and Affordability Initiative (AAI) is a global health collaboration between four pharmaceutical companies, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi, and the Gates Foundation.
The program will examine the role of differential pricing and health system strengthening to help improve access to medicines for underserved populations, particularly low-income groups, in LMICs. Differential pricing is a system that enables people to pay according to their means. To date, studies have mainly focused on measuring the impact of differential pricing between countries. The AAI pilot programs are exploring an innovative approach which measures the ability of patients living with NCDs in the same country to access medicines for these conditions when differential pricing is applied. The program will start with two pilot projects in Ghana and the Philippines, with around 3,000 people enrolled in each pilot.
MSD, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi is contributing financial support and project design consultation as well as differential pricing of medicines for use in the pilots. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is contributing financial support for the development and implementation of evaluation programs for the two pilot projects, which are led by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. When the studies conclude in mid-2017, a team from Johns Hopkins University will measure the extent to which the approach is effective and sustainable. The companies will then decide whether to introduce differential pricing for NCD medicines on a wider scale in Ghana and the Philippines, or in other markets.
The AAI is one of the initiatives supporting Access Accelerated, a global partnership of a coalition of biopharmaceutical companies to address the barriers to access for NCDs in LMICs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
While MDR-TB is threatening the global effort to eliminate TB, the high rates of missed or delayed diagnosis are preventing prompt, effective treatment and allowing MDR-TB’s continued spread. The need to address early diagnosis was highlighted as one of the core components of the post-2015 End TB Strategy. The inadequacy of current diagnostic solutions, particularly in terms of point-of-care diagnosis, has been a crucial barrier to efforts to contain the spread of TB infection, especially the more complex drug-resistant strains, with around one in four cases of MDR-TB being detected, and only 50 percent successfully treated.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
As part of the company’s commitment to advance global public health, Janssen, a company of Johnson & Johnson, and the non-profit organisation FIND started a new partnership with the objective to fight against tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).
The partnership draws on their expertise of FIND’s work in increasing access to affordable diagnostic solutions and of Janssen Diagnostics global division, as well as of the company’s experience in pharmaceuticals development and innovative access models.
It will focus on providing increased access to molecular diagnostics tools for TB case detection and MDR-TB diagnosis, and on ensuring accelerated access to effective treatments. In parallel to this program, Janssen and FIND will also collaborate on a variety of projects with other partners, including developers and national TB control programs, in order to close the gap in diagnosis and treatment.

In resource-limited countries, the cost of medicines and diagnostics is one of many barriers to medical care. These countries can also be the hardest hit by diseases such as HIV/AIDS. In fact, low- and middle-income countries defined by the World Bank as developing economies, including sub-Saharan Africa, are home to 87% of all people living with HIV/AIDS.
There is a need for increased access to reliable diagnostic testing alongside afforable treatment options for people infected with HIV/AIDS.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Roche has committed to transparent pricing and patent policies to address barriers to its HIV diagnostics tests and second-line HIV protease inhibitor medicine in countries where resources are scarcest and the need for treatment is greatest.
Roche supplies its protease inhibitor Invirase (saquinavir) at non-profit prices for people living in the low-income countries, including all of sub Saharan Africa (SSA). This covers 63 countries, which are home to 64% of all people living with HIV/AIDS.
These are the lowest prices at which the medicines can viably be sold in the long term and do not reflect research or development costs, marketing costs, distribution costs or company overheads. No-profit prices are annually reviewed and adjusted when necessary to ensure they remain no-profit. Roche also supplies Invirase at significantly reduced prices in middle-income and emerging countries where HIV/AIDS is a growing problem. 
Since 2007, the company has provided Valcyte (valganciclovir), an oral medication for treating AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR), at reduced prices for AIDS treatment programmes led by non-governmental organisations in low- and middle-income countries and in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, through a purchase agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, Roche further reduced the price for Valcyte for use in HIV patients, making it 90% cheaper for 138 developing countries, including a number of upper middle-income countries such as India and China.
Through the AmpliCare program, Roche supplies diagnostic HIV tests at the lowest possible price in SSA countries and several countries in South America and Asia.
Roche does not file for new patents or enforce existing patents on Roche medicines in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) or low income countries. In addition, Roche does not file or enforce patents for antiretroviral HIV medicines in sub-Saharan Africa. Not applying patents in these regions enables generic versions of Roche medicines to be produced and distributed in these countries without applying for a license. In addition, through programs like Roche’s Technology Transfer Initiative (completed in 2010), local manufacturers now have the necessary skills to produce generic versions of the HIV medications.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Non-profit and reduced pricing addresses affordability, with prices similar to or below those of generic versions of the medicines. The reduced prices apply to 87% of all people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Resource-limited countries are among the hardest hit by diseases such as HIV/AIDS; the vast majority of people living with HIV are in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. There are 3.2 million children worldwide living with HIV, most infected by HIV+ mothers during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. Without antiretroviral treatment, 50 percent of infants living with HIV/AIDS will die by the age of two, and 80 percent by the age of five.
It is estimated that less than a quarter of all children infected with HIV worldwide are receiving antiretrovirals. Therefore, it is critical to develop innovative formulations to meet this unmet medical need while ensuring access to existing therapies.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
MSD has entered into an agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to license its pediatric formulations of raltegravir—chewable tablets and granules for oral suspension— for use in treating HIV-1 infection in infants and children from four weeks to under 12 years of age. This is the MPP’s first agreement to provide access to an HIV integrase inhibitor for use in combination HIV therapy for infants and children in this age range. The agreement also allows for development of novel pediatric formulations of raltegravir and novel combinations.
Raltegravir is the only integrase inhibitor approved for use in infants and children as young as four weeks in the United States and European Union. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines have listed raltegravir as an important product needed for certain pediatric populations.
The agreement is designed to improve access to raltegravir for pediatric populations in low- and middle-income countries with significantly high rates of pediatric HIV, totalling 92 countries. In addition to providing expanded access, the agreement allows for development of new pediatric formulations of raltegravir, in support of the “Global Pediatric Antiretroviral Commitment-to-Action” announced by the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Pediatric HIV Treatment Initiative (PHTI), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to accelerate the development of new, high-priority pediatric antiretroviral co-formulations.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
An obstetric fistula is an injury caused by prolonged obstructed labour, leading to faecal or urinary incontinence or both. It most commonly occurs among women who live in rural communities in low-resource countries, who are not aware that help is available or are unable to reach a hospital. Women with fistula are often subject to severe social stigma due to odour, which is constant and humiliating, and in many cases drives the patients' family, friends and neighbours away. Stigmatised, these women are also often denied access to education and employment and left to live lives of isolation and poverty. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates 3,000 new cases of obstetric fistula occur annually in Kenya, with approximately one to two fistulas for every 1,000 deliveries.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Action on Fistula, supported by a grant from Astellas Pharma Europe Limited, is a programme set up by the Fistula Foundation in 2014 to transform the lives of more than 1,200 women in Kenya living with fistula and build capacity in the country to deliver ongoing surgeries over the long-term. The program has successfully treated double the women it initially aimed to help, by establishing a fistula treatment network, increasing the number of fistula surgeons and significantly boosting the number of surgeries taking place in the country.
The programme has already:
given 2,471 Kenyan women with obstetric fistula life changing reconstructive surgery
significantly increased surgical capacity in Kenya to treat the condition by training six fistula surgeons
set up a fistula treatment network to extend access to services, with six treatment centres enrolled and providing fistula surgeries on a routine basis
built a major outreach programme to identify and bring women in for treatment.
Astellas Pharma Europe is now pledging its support to the Fistula Foundation as the second phase of Action on Fistula launches with an ambitious target to treat 4,500 women with obstetric fistula in Kenya by 2020. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
From May 2017 - April 2020 Action on Fistula will:
provide surgeries to an additional 2,000 women with fistula and continue to build capacity in Kenya to deliver ongoing treatment
extend its treatment network to up to eight treatment centres
train a further six surgeons at the Gynocare Women’s and Fistula Hospital in Kenya, including clinicians from outside the country to build capacity across sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia
train 10 fistula nurses to support women through their treatment journey
establish 20 support groups throughout Kenya to provide recovering fistula patients with psychosocial assistance, economic empowerment and income-generating activities to help enable survivors to return to their communities.
Measurement of progress towards objectives
Estimated overall value of partnership: Through the commitment and skill of the Fistula Foundation working to train surgeons and mobilise outreach teams on the ground in Kenya, Action on Fistula has transformed the lives of more than double the number of women it initially set out to support.
Estimated amount of people impacted: Target to treat 4,500 women with obstetric fistula in Kenya by 2020.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
There are many complex humanitarian crises around the world resulting from political unrest, civil wars, regional famine, and other events that disrupt countries and societies. Many of these are referred to as “silent emergencies” because they are not on the radar of the media and hence not a focus for most donors and funders. In humanitarian crises, particularly the complex humanitarian crises borne from political unrest and long-standing armed conflict, the most vulnerable are women and children.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Johnson & Johnson committed to work with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to provide assistance to the women and children that are disproportionately impacted in these situations.
The IRC has been working in very difficult situations addressing the needs of displaced populations in complex humanitarian crises since WWII.
Responding to crisis and restoring safetyArriving on the scene within 72 hours of an emergency’s onset, the IRC brings urgently needed supplies and expertise to aid people caught in the midst of chaos.
Healing the sick and preventing diseaseDuring a crisis and in its aftermath, the IRC sends teams of doctors and other experts to provide immediate health care, sanitation and clean water.
Rebuilding communities and renewing dignityThe IRC makes the long-term commitment needed to help people to restore their shattered communities and work together toward a peaceful future.
Protecting and empowering women and girlsThe IRC provides reproductive health care to mothers, supports survivors of sexual violence, and creates economic opportunities for women and girls who face enormous obstacles.
Taking care of children and reuniting familiesThe IRC reunifies families separated by conflict and catastrophe, and provides education and recreation programs to help children recover from trauma.
The IRC’s unofficial motto is first in, last out. They respond quickly when humanitarian disasters erupt and continue providing lifesaving assistance as the media spotlights turn elsewhere. As a crisis progresses, different needs emerge.
J&J's support is very flexible and works with the IRC to address the specific needs as they arise. For instance, early on in a crisis, basic needs like food and water, shelter, and basic healthcare are needed. As unrest subsides and peace is restored, other needs around rebuilding civil society needs to be addressed. Subsequently, displaced populations need to be re-integrated into their communities through livelihood and skills training, reducing stigma, and community engagement, etc.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Many people think of tuberculosis as a disease of the past, but the reality is that TB is an urgent public health crisis. Each year, more than 8.5 million people become sick with TB and 1.3 million people die of the disease. In fact, TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, causing one out of every four deaths. It is also the third leading cause of death for women, affecting people during their most productive years (ages 15-44).
While control programs are making progress in reducing deaths from TB, global TB incidence relative to population growth has remained consistently high. There are almost 1 million more cases of TB in the world today (8.6 million) than in 1990 (7.8 million). And because of growing drug resistance, TB is becoming much more difficult and expensive to treat.
Research and development for new vaccines would have the biggest impact on the epidemic, and remains the cornerstone to reaching global elimination within the coming decades.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
The most effective way to stop the global TB epidemic is to prevent the spread of M. tuberculosis, but that is becoming increasingly difficult with the rise of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), the latter of which is resistant to most first- and second-line drugs. 
Aeras was founded in 1997 to develop new concepts and tools to control the global TB epidemic. It is the goal of Aeras to develop, test, characterize, license, manufacture and distribute at least one new TB vaccine within 10 years.
GSK has long been committed to developing an effective tool against TB disease. For about 10 years, the company has been working with organizations such as Aeras in the development of a TB vaccine to ensure access to an effective TB vaccine to the populations who need it most. GSK’s current M72/AS01E candidate prophylactic vaccine has been tested in early stage Phase I/II studies in Europe and TB endemic countries.  In October 2012, GSK and Aeras entered into a new agreement with the goal of assessing the potential efficacy of the M72/AS01E candidate vaccine against TB disease and to investigate biomarkers of risk for TB disease and possible correlates of protection, which would benefit the TB vaccine field in general. The trial is targeted to start in summer 2014 and will enrol more than 3500 participants across several trial sites in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Information on the clinical trials is available online.
First-in-Human Clinical Trials:
First-in-human studies are small studies in healthy adults - usually 20-80 subjects - to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate.
Phase I Clinical Trials:
Phase I clinical trials are small safety studies in different target populations. These may include a preliminary assessment of dose-range and/or age de-escalation.
Phase IIa Clinical Trials:
Phase IIa clinical trials are larger studies - usually 100-300 subjects - that explore dose-range in target populations with the goal of identifying the optimum dose; the dosing schedule; and/or the route of administration based on safety, immunogenicity and/or biological endpoints. These are focused studies designed to provide evidence of biological activity in the target population.
Phase IIb Clinical Trials:
Phase IIb clinical trials are larger, well-controlled studies that evaluate safety and proof-of-concept/efficacy. These trials usually include more than 1,000 subjects and are designed to demonstrate evidence of disease prevention or treatment in the target population.
Phase III Clinical Trials:
Phase III clinical trials are pivotal registration studies to support licensure. They are designed to demonstrate statistically significant evidence of disease prevention or treatment and long-term safety in target populations as required by national regulatory authorities. These studies are conducted with the final manufactured product.
Lessons learned:
South Africa is particularly poised as a key driver of TB vaccine innovation, since it has the highest incidence of the disease and is well-equipped with world-renowned researchers and infrastructure to conduct TB studies. Our in-country partners provide primary and follow-up care to communities involved in clinical trials. They educate the local communities and raise awareness about TB and vaccine trials.
Recently, the successful completion of the first large, Phase IIb trial in South Africa of nearly 3,000 infants showed that it is possible to conduct a trial of that scope and magnitude, even though the vaccine did not prove to be more efficacious than the widely used infant vaccine BCG.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Serving as a critical translational bridge from the bench to the field Aeras has sponsored and conducted over 25 clinical vaccine trials enrolling thousands of subjects, and is a key partner in six active clinical development programs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is caused by parasites of the Plasmodium species, which are spread to people by mosquitoes carrying the parasites. If you are unlucky enough to get an infection, you can expect fever, shivering and vomiting. And if left untreated, it can lead to anaemia, seizures, coma and death.
The cause may be microscopic, but the problem it presents is huge. About half the world’s population is at risk from malaria, with the most infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GSK offers its antimalarials at not-for-profit prices to public sector customers and not-for-profit organizations in low income countries. All Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCM) projects fully funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS TB and Malaria are also eligible.
By embedding the project and malaria focus in to the local governance structures, the projects take steps towards improving local capacity to manage health systems for the prevention and control of malaria. It is important that Community Health Workers (CHWs) are well linked with village governments. To strengthen these linkages, partners conduct workshops in village to engage village leaders. This has resulted in improved support from village government. Additionally, the projects often work with local implementing partners to ensure stronger, more sustainable work with the communities.
The GSK Africa Malaria Partnership currently supports partnerships with non-governmental organisations to build the capacity of CHWs and encourage behaviour change. With a total commitment of £1.5 million over three years our current projects include:
Amref Health Africa in Mtwara Province, Tanzania: The project aims to train CHWs and mobilise communities to become frontline advocates in the fight against malaria.
FHI 360 in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana: Working with CHWs and household caregivers to encourage health seeking behaviours and community mobilisation, the project works to improve early recognition of malaria and provide access to appropriate treatment.
Save the Children in North East Province, Kenya: Through community campaigns, education, bed net distribution, and CHW training, the project has been working to reduce the malaria risk while improving access to primary health care for families in the Wajir district.
The Carter Centre in Plateau and Nasarawa States, Nigeria: Working with the Federal Ministry of Health, the Center is tackling malaria and lymphatic filariasis (LF) together through streamlined health messages, distribution of ITNs, and simplified planning and supervision.

GSK and its partners have also been developing what could be the world’s first vaccine to help protect children in Africa against malaria. The vaccine candidate RTS,S, also known as MosquirixTM, has been developed in partnership with PATH MVI, supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In July 2015, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted RTS,S a positive scientific opinion. This was followed in January 2016 by a position paper from the World Health Organization (WHO) that recommended large-scale pilot implementations of RTS,S in settings of moderate-to-high parasite transmission in Africa. The WHO confirmed in November 2016 that pilot programs will take place from 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa using GSK’s malaria vaccine RTS,S.

Lessons learned                             
Some lessons learned from the Africa Malaria Partnership projects in Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya and Nigeria:
Effective advocacy/mobilization of all stakeholders from the onset of the project contributes to project acceptance.
Working closely with District Health Management Teams helps ensure ownership of the project by the districts with the view to sustaining the activities of the project in the future.
Integration of additional projects, for example, safe motherhood and MNCH projects, has proven to be effective and efficient in reaching the target communities.
Strong community involvement encourages smooth implementation of the project.
Essential to have a risk management plan in place and come up with ready mitigating measures.
Creation of Mothers Against Malaria clubs has been a useful way of getting malaria awareness messages across to other members of the community.
Another common challenge that implementation partners faced were stock-outs of medicine and medical supplies. The projects have addressed this with proper and early planning and also building buffer stocks. To address the inadequate supply of treated bed nets by the government, partners procured bed nets for distribution by the local NGOs to the community while waiting for the stocks of from the Ministry of Health to be replenished. Partners have remained attuned to and aligned with the changing government healthcare policies and guidelines.
Reaching nomadic households and remote villages remains a challenge due to poor roads and/or regional insecurity and the high costs of conducting outreach work. Partners have responded to this challenge by training more CHWs. More health workers means that more vulnerable communities receive preventive services and treatment for malaria and other common childhood illnesses.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Through GSK’s Africa Malaria Partnership (AMP), the company has committed over £4.8 million to community focused programs for the prevention and treatment of malaria. Since 2009, the AMP has partnered with community-based non-governmental organizations with a focus on building capacity of community health workers (CHWs) and encouraging behavioral change.

When ACHAP was established in 2000, more than one in four adults in Botswana was infected with HIV– then the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world. HIV prevalence exceeded 30 percent among men and women in the 25-40 year age group. More than one-third of children born to HIV-positive women became infected with the disease. The number of AIDS orphans quadrupled in five years. Fewer than five percent of those in need of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy were receiving it. Health facilities were overburdened: About 60 percent of hospital beds were occupied by patients who were HIV infected and in need of care. There was a severe shortage of health workers and physicians, particularly those trained in the area of HIV/AIDS. Life expectancy at birth had declined by 13 years and between 1991 and 2003, morbidity increased four-fold among 25-44 year olds. At this rate, the total population of the country was expected to be reduced by 18 percent, while the Gross Domestic Product was projected to decline 4.5 percent annually, resulting in an economy 30 percent smaller than it would have been without AIDS.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2000, MSD* and the Merck Foundation, the government of Botswana, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation established the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnerships (ACHAP).
The project involved Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and Community Based Organizations (CBO) Community and Intergovernmental Organizations (IGO) i.e. UNAIDS, WHO, World Bank etc.
ACHAP's mission is to support and enhance Botswana's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic through a comprehensive approach that includes HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support, and impact mitigation. At its inception, The Merck Foundation and the Gates Foundation established ACHAP with a commitment of USD 106.5 million to the partnership, and MSD agreed to donate its antiretroviral (ARV) medicines—STOCRIN® (efavirenz) and CRIXIVAN® (indinavir sulfate)—to Botswana's national antiretroviral (ARV) treatment program for the partnership's duration. In November 2008, MSD expanded its donations to include ATRIPLA® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) and ISENTRESS® (raltegravir).
Initially, ACHAP’s comprehensive approach included the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, care and support for those infected and mitigation of the disease’s effect on the community. In 2010, The Merck Foundation committed an additional $30 million over five years (2010–2014) to support Phase II of ACHAP. This additional funding enabled ACHAP to build on its progress by:
Positioning ACHAP as a successful country-led, public-private partnership model, now and in the future, through focused and sustained stakeholder relations and engagement;
Systematically transitioning the support of the antiretroviral (ARV) treatment program to the government of Botswana;
Supporting the scale up of safe male circumcision among HIV-negative males aged 15–29 years;
Strengthening the National Tuberculosis (TB) Programme in order to improve access to and utilization of integrated TB and HIV services by 2014;
Improving the generation, utilization and sharing of strategic information and knowledge from HIV/AIDS and TB programs in Botswana in order to inform and improve programs in Botswana and the region by 2014.
From the beginning, MSD and the Gates Foundation have sought to create a program that would leverage private-sector management expertise to resolve social and public health issues. They also hoped to create a model of care, which, if successful, could inform and encourage others in government, international organizations, foundations and the private sector working to address HIV/AIDS in other countries or regions.
Lessons learned
MSD's in Botswana has taught valuable lessons about implementing an appropriate response to HIV/AIDS:
A successful national response to HIV/AIDS requires a sound policy designed to enable stakeholders to drive and guide the right course of action;
Local, national and international partners must integrate and align all efforts with the national blueprint;
Success depends on building local capacity and gaining agreement on a common strategy at all levels;
It is possible to implement effective ARV therapy in the public health sector, even in a resource-limited setting;
A sustainable solution must address both treatment and prevention;
ACHAP is considered an important model for addressing the African HIV epidemic, and the lessons learned can help to inform positive action in other countries in the region;
Working collaboratively and in a complementary fashion with other development partners enables the expansion and strengthening of key programs.
ACHAP is considered an important model to address the African HIV epidemic and lessons learned can be leveraged to inform positive action in other countries in the region and internationally. Working collaboratively and in a complimentary fashion with other development partners has enabled the expansion and strengthening of key programs and avoided duplication of efforts.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
ACHAP has helped reduce both the number of deaths and the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout Botswana. A sampling of its achievements:
People on treatmnt increased from around 93,000 in 2007 to 229,055 by the end of December 2013;
Halved the mortality rate in adults, saving over 50,000 lives between 2002 and  2007;
Dramatically reduced mother-to-child transmission and reduced new infections among children by at least 80 percent (from around 40 percent zero--conversion to less than 5 percent);
Developed sustainable treatment by supporting the recruitment of over 200 positions, on civil service terms, to help staff the treatment program and its rollout to the clinics over the project period;
Increased laboratory capacity so that more than 130,000 patients could be supported in their treatment in the public sector;
Supported the development of the first National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS (2003–2009) and the second National Strategic Framework (2010–2016).

            What are the health needs and challenges?           
Depression and diabetes are often comorbid and complicate each other. The prognosis for people with both diabetes and depression is often worse than when people have only one of these conditions. This is not generally well-known or recognized, and most healthcare systems do not support optimal treatment of both diseases. Fragmentation of medicine within highly specialized institutions and practitioners can mean that only one of these comorbid diseases is recognized and treated. Such practices can expose patients to unnecessary complications and health services to significantly higher costs of care.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The African Nurse Training Program (ANTP) is organized by the International Council of Nurses (ICN) in collaboration with the Association for the Improvement of Mental Health Programs (AIMHP). ANTP is a ‘train-the-trainer’ program and is organized within the framework of the Diabetes and Depression (DDD) initiative. DDD is a collaboration involving several international organizations and is coordinated by the AIMHP.
ANTP aims to improve the awareness, recognition and management of comorbid depression and diabetes. This will reduce comorbid outcomes.
With the goal of improving the awareness, recognition and management of comorbid depression and diabetes, ANTP will provide international healthcare experts to support nurses in the above-mentioned African countries to meet this challenge.
The progam is composed of ten modules that ‘unpack’ the comorbid relationship between diabetes and depression and focus on assessment, clinical management, health education and the environment of health care.
The involvement of local experts is extremely important in order to understand the issues and cultural differences. The use of newsletters and websites offer continuing support to the target group, keeping them motivated. Patient tools are also created in the form of hand-outs and translated into local dialect so they can used in local clinic settings.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Cancer is an emerging public health problem throughout the African Region; and breast and cervical cancers are among the most common cancers affecting women. In sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of cervical cancer and breast cancer is no higher than in other parts of the world, but the risk of death among women with either disease is much higher than in high-income countries – eight times higher in the case of cervical cancer. This is because too many African women are diagnosed too late which hampers effective treatment and care. In sub-Saharan Africa, 22.5 per 100,000 women die from cervical cancer, compared to 2.5 per 100,000 women in North America.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
WHO AFRO is one of the six regions of WHO whose mission is the attainment by all peoples of the highest level of health across Sub-Saharan Africa. The Organization’s presence in the region consists of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, a Secretariat for the African Region, three Inter-country Support Teams (ISTs), WHO Country Offices located in 47 Member States, and a Liaison Office for the AU and ECA located in Addis Ababa.
The AFRO Comprehensive Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control Initiative will work across the African Region to improve awareness; help empower women and healthcare professionals to improve prevention, screening and treatment rates of breast and cervical cancers. 
Supported by some funding and in-kind contributions from IFPMA, the partnership will implement cancer prevention and control activities in four countries with a high burden of cervical cancer: Cameroon, Uganda, Swaziland and Zambia, in collaboration with the respective ministries of health. In addition, the partnership will work with healthcare providers to improve their knowledge about screening strategies.
“There are many obstacles to cervical cancer screening in resource-constrained countries, generally attributed to the lack of infrastructure as well as technical, medical and financial resources, and a lack of awareness and education on cervical cancer among women and healthcare providers,” explains Dr Abdikamal Alisalad, Acting Director, Non-Communicable Diseases, at WHO Regional Office for Africa. Many lives can be saved if public awareness is strengthened on the importance of testing and early treatment,” he added. 
“Partnerships are the way forward when dealing with complex challenges such as those posed by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Working across sectors enables partners to generate health outcomes that are transformational, hence sustainable. We are delighted to support WHO AFRO in implementing strategies that help alleviate the NCD burden in low- and middle-income countries,”says Eduardo Pisani, Director General, IFPMA.  He adds, “IFPMA has been pioneering sector-wide partnerships that address prevention of NCDs for a number of years now, working with a wide range of partners including the PAHO Foundation, The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, The International Telecommunication Union, and The World Health Professions Alliance”. 
Commenting on the need to strengthen public-private partnerships such as this one, Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Head Secretariat of the WHO Global Coordinating Mechanism on NCDs (GCM/NCD) at WHO HQ in Geneva said: “There is an urgent need to scale up the multiple contributions from the diverse range of private sector entities for the prevention and control of NCDs at national level, while effectively safeguarding public health interests from undue influence by any form of real, perceived or potential conflict of interest. This is a concrete example of how governments can work with the private sector to realize their commitments on NCDs, as outlined and promised through high-level political declarations.”

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Many people in Kenya live in poverty and lack access to quality healthcare. Screening, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care for cancer are in very scarce supply in Kenya, with only two cancer centers for the country’s 42 million people. Much of the screening and care provided could only be done in substandard facilities. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcar (AMPATH) was created in response to the HIV crisis in Western Kenya in 2001. It is built on a partnership with Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and the Moi University School of Medicine in Eldoret, Kenya, and a consortium of North American academic health centers, led by Indiana University. AMPATH has continually expanded its successful HIV approach to include more diseases, including diabetes, hypertension and cancer.
As an extension of this work, the AMPATH Oncology Institute was launched in 2009—with a single physician and nurse. Public-private partnerships have allowed the institute to expand its staff and services to a current team that includes 10 clinicians, six core nurses and an oncology pharmacist. The institute received nearly 10,000 patient visits last year and screened more than 10,000 women for breast cancer and 20,000 women for cervical cancer. But demand far outstrips supply.
Since 2002, Lilly has donated nearly $60 million in medicines to AMPATH to improve health for people with diabetes, mental illness and cancer. In February 2015 Lilly Foundation announced an additional commitment of $1 million to AMPATH. The funding helped equipping a new oncology center, hire additional staff and train local healthcare professionals—ultimately allowing AMPATH to screen, treat and provide palliative care to more people, many of whom lack access to quality health services.
The Lilly Foundation's funding helped equip the center's new oncology outpatient center and allowed for the hiring of additional doctors, physicians' assistants and other staff to screen and treat more people. Additionally, the funding supports the creation of a research and training institute focused on cancer prevention, screening, treatment and supportive care. The institute also helps building much-needed capacity among local healthcare providers.The AMPATH Oncology Institute provides access to quality cancer care to the 18 million people residing in western Kenya.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Diagnosis and monitoring are as essential to effective HIV/AIDS treatment as medicines.  In infants born of HIV-positive mothers, early diagnosis is critical in determining HIV exposure. If found HIV positive, they can receive appropriate medical care before they develop significant illness, and can remain healthy despite their infection. If found HIV negative, the mother can get appropriate counselling to ensure their child maintains a HIV-free status. Doctors also need to monitor disease progression and efficacy of treatment in patients on anti-retroviral therapies so they can prescribe the most effective medicine and make adjustments if patients become resistant.
However, limited testing infrastructure, long travel distances and technological limitations often result in people not returning to collect their test results, or even being tested in the first place. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
AmpliCare is a multi-faceted program to address barriers that prevent early diagnosis of infants born to HIV positive mothers along with monitoring people on anti-retroviral therapies. Introduced in 2002, it operates in sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of South America and Asia where the disease burden is the highest.
The program includes:
Using Roche R&D expertise to re-design tests and delivery of test results to suit local conditions
Building laboratory capacity and enhancing skills of lab technicians to support reliable testing
Introducing differential pricing for HIV diagnostic tests in partnership with international health organisations. 
To overcome some of the barriers, Roche re-designed its tests and developed a novel method for gathering and transporting blood samples. For example, by using dried blood spots which require only a small amount of blood and can be sent for testing via the post, early infant diagnosis is now more accessible.
The company also introduced text message (SMS) technology, making it easier to send test results back to rural healthcare facilities, saving people from having to return to the main testing site for their results.
The improved communication has several benefits:
Test results are easily and quickly sent to rural locations
Patient follow-up is improved by reducing logistical bottlenecks
Patients don’t need to revisit the lab, which are often located only in major towns
The collection card has expanded access to HIV diagnosis throughout the remotest areas of southern Africa. Roche continues to work with other organisations in public-private partnerships to ensure subsequent medical care for babies with HIV.
Recent advances have enabled to transfer lessons learned in the early infant diagnosis program to the use of dried blood spots in viral load testing. The viral load test measures the amount of the virus in the blood stream and is necessary to monitor the efficacy of HIV treatment in anyone undergoing treatment.
An education program trains local doctors and nurses to carry out viral load testing with limited resources, and keeps them fully informed about the latest advances in HIV/AIDS care.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Working in partnership with local communities and hospitals and international agencies such as UNICEF, UNITAID, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc., AmpliCare is building and equipping laboratories, training healthcare workers, and diagnosing and monitoring HIV/AIDS patients.
More than 100 laboratory technicians across sub-Saharan Africa are trained annually at our Roche Scientific Campus and partner training facilities in South Africa. This training is now being augmented by additional programs which will train healthcare workers in all facets of laboratory medicine.
Results since 2008:
Over 6,000,000 infants tested for HIV
Over 15,000,000 patients on HIV/AIDS therapy monitored for viral levels

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a multiple disease burden. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging, and their risk factors are becoming more common as lifestyles change due to rapid urbanization, especially in poor communities. Environmental and lifestyle effects of urbanization, targeted marketing for alcohol and cigarettes, gender and   social norms also add to a rise in NCDs, especially in women. Simultaneously, epidemics of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis persist in the region. According to UNAIDS, one third of persons screened at HIV testing sites are obese and have Hypertension.
Given the declining HIV/AIDS mortality rates and longer life expectancy due to the up-scaling of ART with its concomitant metabolic complications, evidence has shown that HIV-infected adults on ART have a much higher risk of developing other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,  chronic obstructive lung diseases as well as kidney disease. Other HIV/AIDS comorbid diseases on the increase include common female cancers such as cervical and breast cancer as well mental illness and substance abuse. Two thirds of premature deaths (between 30-70yrs) are linked to exposure to NCD risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, poor diet and physical inactivity and poor healthcare services. Since the advent of ART, HIV-infected women are no longer dying from opportunistic infections, but are living long enough to develop and die from cervical and breast cancer. In South Africa, breast cancer and cervical cancer remain the most common cancers amongst women. According to the HPV Information Centre, the estimated number of new cases of cervical cancer in South Africa is over 7,000 per annum with an age-standardized rate of 31.7/100 000 . The estimated number of deaths among women in South Africa from cervical cancer is approximately over 4200 each year. This higher prevalence of cervical cancer and pre-cancer disease is also due to co-infection of patients with HIV and the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the causal agent for cervical cancer. 60-80% of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with the HPV virus, placing them at substantially increased risk for cervical cancer. The risk of cervical cancer in HIV-infected women has been found to be three times higher than in HIV-uninfected women globally. This calls for a scale up of efforts to reduce the risk of invasive cervical cancer through screening programs targeting HIV positive women with the ultimate goal of expanding the services to HIV uninfected women. 
On the other hand 50% of HIV transmission takes place among those aged 15–24 and 5 000–6000 young people become infected every day because of poor access to health services and commodities, early sexual debut, sexual coercion and violence,  growing up without parents and abuse.. For those on ART, adherence may further be compromised due to partial or non-disclosure by their parents or caregivers, usually a grandparent, as well as lack of psychosocial support.  Awareness and education programs for adolescents and young adults on risk factors for STIs, common cancers and the effects of smoking and alcohol use are not sub optimal in South Africa.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Project Objectives
To create partnerships and collaborations to strengthen the reduction of premature deaths from AIDS related cancers HIV, TB, and other NCDs and increase life expectancy in communities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?  In 2010, Ghana had only 10 urologists for a population of over 20 million.
However, in Ghana, many women suffer obstetric fistulas (open connections) which cause them to become incontinent due to long and uncontrolled deliveries or other traumas. Furthermore, obstetric fistula also poses a serious social problem in deriving women of their dignity, as these patients are frequently abandoned by their partners or exiled from communities because others regard them as ""unclean.""Such patients typically remain untreated since medical care for fistula requires high levels of medical skill and knowledge in urology. 
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
Eleven Dutch doctors went to Ghana for the exchange program in the Autumn 2010. For four days the doctors operated in three operating theatres continuously and Astellas fulfilled a facilitating, coordinating and supporting role in the project. Twenty-five women were successfully treated and cured of incontinence. In January 2011, an evaluation meeting was organized to share the experiences with other Dutch urologists and plan subsequent exchange trips for the following years.

"26","Angola Sickle Cell Initiative (ASCI)","
        
        
            Partnership objectives
The Angola Sickle Cell Initiative (ASCI), a public-private partnership of the Angola Ministry of Health, the Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI), Texas Children’s Hospital and Chevron, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, is a comprehensive sickle cell anemia program that provides screening, diagnosis, care, treatment, monitoring and evaluation, research, capacity building, community mobilization, and health professional training in Angola. 
In June 2016, ASCI teamed up with Bristol-Myers Squibb to provide to provide children with sickle cell disease in Angola with an effective medication to which many patients in the country have lacked access.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder in which red blood cells become irregularly shaped. These sickle-shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body, resulting in painful episodes, serious infections, chronic anemia, damage to body organs and stroke, among other complications. 
Angola has one of the world's highest rates of the genetic blood condition with up to 10,000 babies born with the disease each year. By some estimates, up to 50 percent of these children die before five years of age. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Droxia (hydroxyurea) is a potentially life-altering medication that reduces the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions in sickle cell patients. However, most patients in Angola have not had access to hydroxyurea.
The partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb will specifically provide thousands of Angolan children regular access to Droxia. This new five-year demonstration program is intended to build understanding of the effectiveness of treating children in resource-limited settings and to establish the cost benefits to the healthcare systems.
Bristol-Myers Squibb will provide Droxia for up to 1,200 children during the first two years of the program, increasing this to up to 4,100 after that pilot period. The program will launch in Luanda and Cabinda and later expand to additional sites. Last year, Bristol-Myers Squibb made an initial donation of Droxia to the Angola Sickle Cell Initiative.
The Angola Sickle Cell Initiative will provide medical care and management of the drug to children in the treatment program. The Angolan Ministry of Health has committed to the continued treatment of all the children on hydroxyurea when they reach 10 years old.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The Angola Sickle Cell Initiative (ASCI) has been in place in Angola since 2011. Before its launch, newborns were not screened for the disease. Since 2011, more than 150,000 babies have been screened and more than 1,700 babies and children are now in care and treatment. 
ASCI also includes an education and training component. More than 1,500 Angolans have been trained through the program, including local physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, phlebotomists, social workers and research coordinators.
Leaders of this new treatment initiative with Bristol-Myers Squibb hope to demonstrate over the five years the health benefits and cost effectiveness of a hydroxyurea treatment program for infants with sickle cell disease, and use patient data and outcomes as the foundation for an advocacy plan to provide treatment to all children in Angola and throughout the continent. Hydroxyurea currently has generic status and is on the World Health Organization List of Essential Medicines.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
For the year 2011/2012 and 2013/2014, Astellas has invited two fellows for training on clinical R&D as part of the WHO/TDR’s Career Development Fellowship (CDF).
Astellas created curricula which enable the fellows to learn all phases of a compound’s clinical development which include good clinical practice, development strategy and project management, clinical research design, writing clinical study reports and manuscripts, evaluating and reporting safety data and the planning for operational aspects for proper oversight and conducting clinical trials.
The project allows fellows to learn how to work with the regulatory agencies in both the US (FDA) and EU (EMA). In addition, the project teams with which these fellows are assigned provide them the opportunity to work with global teams and develop a better understanding of how to achieve conflict resolution, timeline management, prioritization of activities and develop presentations to executive management to achieve support for plans. The skills they acquired through these curricula will have a meaningful impact on their home institutions.   
Lessons learned
Astellas found this program very useful in serving as an opportunity to learn about clinical research in other parts of the world, provind the opportunity for team members to improve communication and time management skills and bringing development and medical affairs in the shared objective of global development.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
A Botswanan research medical officer, Dr. Tafireyi Marukutira, was the Astellas fellow between April 2011 and March 2012. Dr Marukutira focused primarily on working with the micafungin pediatric and the isavuconazole teams, both in late stage development (Phase 3/3b). Therefore, he was able to consider related and/or multi-factorial health problems for HIV patients and the impact clinical research has on diseases of endemic countries in the pediatric patients. He has now established a partnership with the CDC in carrying on key clinical research.
Astellas is currently hosting a fellow from Ethiopia though July 2014.

            Partnership objectives
AstraZeneca’s Young Health Programme (YHP) has a unique focus on young people and primary prevention of the most common non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart and respiratory disease.
Working with other expert organisations and combining on the ground programmes, research and advocacy, it targets the risk behaviours such as tobacco use, alcohol abuse and unhealthy eating that can lead to these diseases in adulthood.
A particular focus is placed on working with marginalised young people.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
NCDs kill 38 million people each year.1
Diabetes, cancer, heart and respiratory disease related deaths account for 82% of all NCD deaths.1
Sixteen million NCD deaths occur before the age of 70 and 82% of these deaths occurred in low-and-middle income countries.2
70% of premature deaths in adults are largely caused by behaviours started in adolescents.3
These statistics highlight the devastating impact of NCDs on a global scale. 
Why adolescents?
Adolescents make up 25% world’s population4. The foundations for good health in adulthood are set between the ages of 10 and 19, yet adolescent health remains an underserved part of the healthcare agenda, lagging behind the improvements in health among younger children over the past 50 years. 
At the core of the YHP is the commitment to ensure young people are engaged and have a voice in identifying their health needs as well as planning and delivering the solutions. When adolescents are empowered to participate, it results in decisions that better respond to their needs and concerns, contributing to improved development outcomes over the longer term.
The YHP focuses on prevention during adolescence because that is when risk behaviours such as tobacco use, alcohol abuse and unhealthy eating usually start. Scientific research has shown that these behaviours, once formed, are hard to change and can lead to major NCDs like type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart and respiratory disease, later in life.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Founded in 2010 in partnership with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Plan International, the YHP is currently working together with over 30 expert organisations to improve the future health of young people around the world through on the ground programmes, research and advocacy.
YHP On the Ground Programmes
The YHP is designed with the flexibility to work with local partners to identify NCD risk behaviours of young people in local communities and put tailored programmes in place that will help improve their future health and life chances.
Examples of the YHP on the ground programmes:
Russia: A focus on smoking and sport, for  adolescents in orphanages.
Brazil and India: Health issues including tobacco use, unhealthy eating, plus the immediate need to address hygiene and sanitation in India.
China: Protection against air pollution for migrant children and young people.
Romania: Cardiovascular risk prevention. 
Kenya: Prevention of the key risk behaviours.
For more information see: Country Programmes.
YHP Research and Evidence Generation
Research is a key part of the YHP. Working closely with grass roots organisations, academics, opinion leaders and policy makers, we support research programmes which help generate the evidence required to prioritise adolescent health and get the prevention of NCDs like type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart and respiratory disease, on the global healthcare policy agenda.
For more information see: Research and evidence generation.
YHP Advocacy
Advocacy has a vital role to play in getting adolescent health and the prevention of adolescent risk behaviours on the global health agenda and the YHP conducts and supports advocacy activities at many levels. Globally, it participates in targeted public and political health platforms to champion the prioritisation of adolescent health and the inclusion of NCD prevention in global policies and programmes. Locally, it also works with non-governmental organisation (NGO) partners to promote young people’s participation in policy making and improve healthcare services provided for young people.
For more information see: Advocacy.
Since its launch in 2010 Programmes have spanned 20 countries across 5 continents.
To date we have reached:
+ 1.4 million young people
+ 12,000 health workers
and trained + 27,000 peer educators, making a positive impact on healthcare services provided for young people around the world, making a positive impact on healthcare services provided for young people around the world.
The YHP directly aligns to Sustainable Development Goal 3 ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.’ Through the continued combination of on the ground programmes, research and advocacy focused on NCD prevention and by ensuring youth is heard, the YHP will seek sustainable change that directly supports the target of ‘By 2030 reducing by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.’

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The current six- to eight-month standard therapy for tuberculosis (TB) is based on four drugs that were discovered more than 30 years ago and often have to be administered under the direct supervision of healthcare professionals. The long period makes consistent treatment more difficult to achieve, and the number of resistant strains of bacteria is therefore increasing. The available medicines are not effective against the multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) caused by resistant bacteria.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2011 Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals agreed with the World Health Organization (WHO) to support countries in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with moxifloxacin, a well-known antibiotic for the treatment of acute respiratory infection as well as other infections with an established safety record. 
The collaboration with the WHO includes the involvement in a program designed to support increased access to quality-assured second-line anti-tuberculosis which targets to increase treatment success against MDR-TB and thereby could also reduce the likelihood for further resistance development to anti tuberculosis drug.
STOP TB partnership of the WHO makes moxifloxacin available to MDR TB patients in need under specifically defined conditions of treatment programs authorized by the STOP-TB Partnership in collaboration with national TB treatment programs.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Sixteen countries have joined the program since December 2011. A total of around 1.3 million moxifloxacin tablets were supplied to six countries (China, Georgia, Armenia, Haiti, Russia and Indonesia) in 2013. This quantity of the drug enables the treatment of a good 2,450 MDR-TB patients for the minimum treatment period of 18 months.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide,causing 38 million deaths per year, and dominate health care needs and expenditure. NCDs are responsible for over 60% of deaths and represent a complex global challenge impacting high, middle and low-income countries. While most high-income countries have integrated NCDs into public health policies for a number of years, significant gaps remain in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Almost three quarters of these deaths occur in low and middle-income countries, many of which are premature and preventable. Certain lifestyle behaviours can have a contributing effect to the prevalence and severity of NCDs, particularly; tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.
However, mobile technology penetration is high in these developing countries, with 90% of people having access to mobile phone networks. This presents an opportunity to harness mobile technology for improving the availability of information regarding treatments and behaviour changes, enabling effective prevention and management of NCDs. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address the needs and challenges
A number of countries are already using mobile technology to deliver health promotion messages on the NCD risk factors, to survey the epidemic, to persuade users to change unhealthy behaviours and to help countries implement national laws on NCDs. This initiative builds on these successful pilots and scales them up in other countries. The WHO will provide the technical assistance and the ITU will help implement country projects through government partnerships with the support from the private sector.
The initiative, in its initial 4-year period, will scale up mobile technology in eight priority countries, at least one in each region, for NCDs prevention, treatment and policy enforcement. Activities will be two-fold: mHealth operational projects will be implemented within countries, and standard operating procedures will be developed for running mHealth NCDs intervention package to support more traditional NCDs prevention and control work. Specific countries will be able to sponsor and patron the initiative. At the country level implementing agencies will help roll out the operational projects, provide products and technical know-how as well as contribute to the resources.
Mobile solutions will be primarily SMS or apps based and will include a range of services such as mAwareness, mTraining, mBehavioural change, mSurveillance, mTreatment, mDisease management and mScreening building on existing successful pilots and scaling them to a population level. Countries will choose the interventions that best suit their needs. The application areas will be marked across Prevention, Treatment and Enforcement for NCDs, and will grow based on requirements. 
With the addition of Sanofi to the campaign, Be He@lthy, Be Mobile now involves 'two-way' SMS messaging about reminders to patients on topics such as their blood glucose levels and food intake, as part of the program mDiabetes.
The initiative has been so far rolled out in eight countries: Costa Rica, where the government has chosen to focus on mobile technology for smoking prevention and helping smokers quit, Senegal, Zambia, India, Norway, Philippnes, Tunisia and the United Kingdom. 
In 2015, the initiative also developed handbooks for running mHealth national programmes to support more traditional NCD prevention and management work including mTobaccoCessation, mDiabetes, mCervicalCancer, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Digital Health Platform.
Be He@lthy, Be Mobile is dependent on voluntary contributions from its global partners to supplement the funds that participating countries and local partners contribute domestically. Be He@lthy, Be Mobile aims to raise $10 million over 4 years, in line with the signed agreement between WHO and ITU. These funds are used to support global technical work and select country operations. 
On this partnership, Eduardo Pisani, Director General of IFPMA, has stated: ""I believe that the ITU partnership is a good example of such an intersectoral approach that links different players and sectors in a modern, practical, and focused fashion.""
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
In 2015, the third year of the initiative, Be He@lthy, Be Mobile successfully met its goal to launch or prepare mHealth programmes in all eight target countries (Costa Rica, Senegal, Tunisia, Norway, India, Zambia, the UK and the Philippines). These countries were selected because of their high burden of NCDs, technological preparedness and political commitment to the initiative. 
The projects have already had a significant on the management and prevention of NCDs within the country scope. The smoking cessation SMS support programme in Costa Rica has resulted in a 10% quit rate, which is two times the usual cessation figure. In addition, the mDiabetes programme in Senegal has effectively increased awareness of the disease, helped train health workers through mTraining and also helped patients with disease management through remote consultations and support. 
The 8 projects currently in operation are generating significant results which could be replicated across other countries. The construction of toolkits will also inform other countries on how best to harness mobile technology for the prevention and control of NCDs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Over 10 million people are estimated to die from hypertension (high blood pressure) globally every year. Hypertension is the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Hypertension often doesn’t show any symptoms and so is often referred to as the “silent killer.” If left unaddressed, it can lead to heart disease, stroke or kidney failure.
There is a lot of evidence on how to prevent, treat and manage hypertension but it continues to be poorly controlled, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Although the problem of hypertension is a global challenge, low- and middle-income countries are hit the hardest. Rapid urbanization seems to be a key driver of this increasing burden.
Health systems in low- and middle-income countries are mainly geared toward acute care and are often not set up to provide care for chronic diseases like cardiovascular health problems. Patients also face barriers to seeking and following treatment, for example affordability and the patient’s capacity to pay for the care they need.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
Today's urban health challenges are complex, involving factors as broad as lifestyle choices, diet, transport, workplace practices and air pollution. These challenges are systemic and cannot be tackled by one organization alone. We believe that by collaborating with local and global partners across a range of sectors, we can co-design and implement holistic solutions for healthier cities and communities.
To achieve this, Better Hearts Better Cities builds networks of partners, reaching beyond the health sector. Partners can include healthcare providers but also digital and telecommunication organizations, food suppliers, employers, insurance funds, social enterprises and civil societies. Made up of both public and private organizations, these networks operate globally and at the local level.
This multisector approach aims to integrate complementary capabilities and resources to tackle hypertension from health literacy and lifestyle choices, to prevention, screening, diagnosis and patient management.
Crucial to the success of Better Hearts Better Cities is local ownership; not only to build a network of implementation partners, but to achieve longer-term impact and sustainability by working with local governments to strengthen health systems.
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
Initially, Better Hearts Better Cities will demonstrate the approach in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), Dakar (Senegal) and Sao Paulo (Brazil). These first cities aim to establish conditions for the successful integration of Better Hearts Better Cities in other cities worldwide.
Through its focus on hypertension, Better Hearts Better Cities aspires to create an approach for chronic disease prevention and care, particularly in low-income urban communities. Learnings from Better Hearts Better Cities in each city will be applied to the other sites, as well as shared with the global health community.
Learnings from Better Hearts Better Cities will help to advance the common agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly goals 3 and 17, by translating global goals to local agendas.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In India, more than 1.3 million people develop cancer each year. Cancer is the third highest cause of death amongst non-communicable diseases (NCDs).  Although affordability is often cited as the cause of this poor cancer care access, there are many other barriers to treatment. These include late diagnosis, limited and hard to-reach infrastructure, low awareness of treatment options, inadequate biomarker testing, lack of reimbursement of medicines, and poor adherence to treatment. Only one out of four patients who are prescribed medicines actually starts the treatment and only a few of these barriers are being addressed.
India does not have universal access to healthcare or centralized payers, however it does have large central and regional healthcare funding programs. These programs typically offer coverage to government employees and their families. A few programs are also designed for the economically disadvantaged segment of the population.  In addition, various NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and pharmaceutical companies provide patient assistance programmes. 
Hence, it can be confusing for a patient to be able to navigate these multiple challenges and platforms for initiating cancer therapy. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In order to properly tackle the full range of barriers to cancer care, Roche India developed The Blue Tree programme. This single platform supports patients and their families with disease awareness and testing, funding solutions, home delivery of medicines, free medicines, treatment adherence support and standardised reports.
The program is managed by Saarathi Healthcare and supported by Roche. Once patients have joined the programme, the tele-coordinators from Saarathi stay in constant contact with patients by helping them navigate through The Blue Tree service offerings like:
Liaising with Oncquest and Dr. Lal Pathlabs for diagnostic testing.
Providing clear and reliable information on cancer to help them understand and manage their disease and treatment
Guiding patients who are eligible for government reimbursement through completing the documentation.
Help patient recall and/or identify additional sources of funding.
Aid patients to finance their treatment through a bank loan with ICICI Bank, provided at attractive terms. The loan can be repaid within 6-60 months to the bank.
Assist eligible patients unable to continue treatment due to financial reasons obtain medicines at no cost from S K Distributor to support patients completing the final stages of therapy.
Address issues of reach and availability and ensure delivery of Roche medicines at a location convenient to the patient through the service of S K Distributor and Medybiz.
Saarathi tele-coordinators call the patients once a month to remind them of their infusion dates and also 48 hours prior to their infusion.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The programme has received strong support from physicians. In 2015, more than 750 doctors supported the programme, resulting in over 1,200 patients enrolling. Patients who enrolled showed a 40% increase in therapy adherence rates.  Program statistics indicate that in 2015, 50% of patients who enquired about the programme enrolled and benefited from its services. This percentage has increased to 76% in Q1 2016 alone. 
Since March 2015, The Blue Tree has helped over 2600 patients and aims to add more services like home infusion to make treatment easier for patients. An additional impact of this offering is the increasing trust and value established with physicians and the doubling of patient enrolments per month over the last 6 months.

BMS was one of the first companies to state that it would not enforce its patents on antiretrovirals in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 2001, the company has entered into twelve immunity-from-suit agreements for their antiretrovirals Videx® (didanosine) and Zerit® (stavudine). In addition, BMS has entered into two Technology Transfer and Licensing agreements and two Immunity From Suit agreements covering their antiretroviral Reyataz® (atazanavir).
In 2013, Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into an agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool which aims to further access to atazanavir in developing world countries.  This agreement includes 110 least developed, low- and middle- income countries where approximately 29 million people are living with HIV.  There is no fixed limit on the number of sublicensees, instead, the aim of this agreement is to create a supply of licensed product that can sustainably meet the demands for atazanavir in the territory, including pediatric formulations.  A key feature of the agreement is that there are no royalties for countries that were part of the legacy agreements or for sublicensee sales of pediatric formulations in any of the 110 countries included in the Territory.  The Medicines Patent Pool collects a small royalty for sales in countries where there are atazanavir patents when the country was not previously included in a legacy atazanavir agreement, however, Bristol-Myers Squibb never receives any of these royalties – instead, as part of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb requested that the Medicines Patent Pool reinvest any royalties collected back into community-based HIV programs.     In 2006, BMS granted a royalty-free license to two generics companies, Aspen (Africa) and Emcure (India), to sell atazanavir in sub-Saharan Africa and India. BMS also transferred technical know-how related to the manufacturing, testing, packaging, storage and handling of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished dosage form of atazanavir to these two generic companies. Also in 2006, BMS agreed to allow generic companies seeking approval of generic combination products (including one or more of BMS’ antiretroviral medicines) for developing countries, under the U.S. PEPFAR program, access to confidential regulatory information as long as these companies were operating under appropriate laws and regulations.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The idea of building an Institute was conceived more than 15 years ago, at a time when health cuts to academic centres was shrinking services and making research more difficult. Something had to be done to ensure that the speciality of pulmonology did not “go backwards”, but instead provide a resource to address the obvious growing burden of lung disease in South Africa. The concept was of a public benefit organisation that would be self-sufficient (not dependent upon University or government funding), yet address the threefold objectives of research excellence, teaching and learning, and community engagement. 
 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Officially opened on 26 April 2000, it is dedicated to the improvement of the understanding of lung health and diseases relevant to the needs of Africa. Located on the campus of the Faculty of Health Sciences, it provides clinical services on an outpatient consultation basis as well as conducting research that is focused on epidemiology, allergy diagnostics, lung physiology, clinical pharmacology, evaluation of novel treatments and community-based interventions for improving disease management and improving health.
The Lung Institute operates as a not-for-profit financially self-sufficient public/private initiative, and continues to contribute meaningful clinical research into priority health issues for Southern Africa with the more than 380 scientific publications to date. In addition, the Knowledge Translation Unit has been able to improve the quality of primary healthcare through the implementation of evidence based clinical practice guidelines and training of more than 20,000 healthcare workers to date.
Eight active clinical trials in asthma, COPD and tuberculosis are underway. The knowledge transfer unit was established to educate South African healthcare workers on use and prescription of antiretrovirals, in light of the increased incidences of TB in people living with HIV/AIDS, and will be extended to workers in sub-Saharan Africa. Doctors from universities / public sector are trained on clinical trial related activities, including clinical trial design, performance and reporting.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Cancer is the second-most common cause of death in Europe and remains a significant health problem. There are currently 3 million new cancer cases and 1.7 million deaths from cancer in the region each year. Central and Eastern European countries, however, have worse cancer incidence and mortality rates than the rest of Europe. About 6 in 10 cancer deaths occur in less developed regions and disparities in cancer persist among the poor, racial minorities and vulnerable people. Cancer illiteracy among the general population, lack of prevention and screening efforts, and limited health care resources are all seen as contributing factors to this gap. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Bridging Cancer Care directs funding and develops partnerships to help narrow the differences in care and outcomes experienced by countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Priorities include capacity building for training oncology, general practice and public health nurses to increase their ability to care for cancer patients in the community, targeting funding at the community level and seeking to improve patient health outcomes and their quality of life.
Bridging Cancer Care creates innovative partnerships with government and civil society organizations to support the public health response to cancer. Funding and initiatives are targeted at the community level for health care worker training (professional and lay), and for community mobilization, education and supportive services that remove barriers to care and support patients as they manage their disease at home and in the community. Bridging Cancer Care focuses on populations disproportionately affected by cancer, including the poor, ethnic minorities and people living in rural communities with limited access to cancer services.
Programs are evaluated for improvements in care capacity patient health outcomes and quality of life. Lessons learned are shared at annual conferences and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation advocates with its partners for improvements in standard of care and enabling policies based on the lessons learned.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 2007, the Foundation has directed grant-making and partnership development to reduce cancer disparities in Central and Eastern Europe with programs focused on a variety of needs, including psychosocial support, disease information, palliative care, care coordination, assessment of cancer services, and building nursing capacity.
In 2010, the Foundation shifted its focus to making grants for projects that improve nursing skills and build nurse/community partnerships. Between 2010 and 2013 the Foundation has awarded 22 Bridging Cancer Care grants for projects in Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. To date, the program has trained 5,700 healthcare workers and provided educational initiatives for 476,000 people. 
In 2010, the Foundation supported the implementation of the End of Life Nursing Education Consortium to improve palliative care in several countries, including Russia and Romania. Also in Romania, a two-year, $95,000 grant supported a project to increase health literacy and improve the quality of life for cancer patients by educating community nurses and forming partnerships between nurses, patients and libraries. A $149,000 grant to World Services of LaCrosse in Russia enhanced cancer nursing skills as well as increased health care system capacity for prevention, screening and care through expanding the scope of practice of the nursing role.
In 2011, the Foundation awarded six grants totaling more than $900,000 to improve cancer awareness, prevention and care by developing cancer nursing skills and building nurse-community partnerships in Hungary, Poland, Romania and Russia. 
In 2012, the Foundation awarded five grants totaling about $750,000 to improve nursing skills for oncology, general practice and public health nurses in the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Russia.
In 2013, the Foundation awarded two, two-year grants totaling $700,000 to establish Cancer Nursing Centers of Excellence in oncology nursing and smoking cessation in Saratov Oblast, Russia, and Prague, Czech Republic. The centers will offer training and technical assistance to nurses and will disseminate lessons and impactful approaches to broader audiences throughout Central and Eastern Europe. 
Current and future partnerships:
Hospice Casa Seperantei will receive $349,979 over two years to establish a Palliative Care Center of Excellence in Romania that will serve Central and Eastern Europe. The Center of Excellence builds upon the organization’s extensive experience and expertise in palliative care.
Project HOPE Poland received $47,803 to continue its work improving early detection of cancer in children in Poland by developing national guidelines that offer best practice advice on investigating and referring children to primary health care when cancer is suspected.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The WHO warns that a “tidal wave” of cancer is looming on the global horizon, with low and middle-income countries increasingly bearing the brunt of it. Yet the vast majority of trained pathologists are located in developed countries, not in these areas of need. For example, in Cameroon, Africa, 5,000 patients share a single pathologist - and the ratio is even more daunting in other parts of the world. This is combined with a lack of specialist training as pathologists who practice in developing countries may not have access to a volume of difficult cases for study, the most current literature, or the advantage of sub-specialty training.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Ventana, a member of the Roche Group, is a leading provider of Digital Pathology solutions – the digitizing of tissue samples that pathologists normally view on glass slides through a microscope.
These “digital slides” which are stored in clouds, can be viewed, analyzed and shared with others, no matter where they live. This means that pathologists in developing countries can send a ‘scan’ of a patient’s sample to experts around the globe to get their help in the diagnosis.
This service enables:
Real-time collaboration for consultations and education across the globe
Expanded access to expertise and specialists from developed countries
Consistency in the evaluation of cancer markers
Improving access to advanced diagnostic and therapeutic expertise, helping to raise the standard of care for patients worldwide
Roche is working to develop innovative solutions, such as educational software to help train and teach the pathologists of the future, to improve the practice of pathology worldwide.
In 2015, Ventana launched a new automated tissue staining system that enhances patient and technician safety and produces good staining quality. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Through Ventana digital pathology slide scanners and image and workflow management software, pathologists are able to scan slides and partner with specialised experts worldwide to help provide the most advanced cancer diagnostics available to their patients.
The Ventana software provides the ability to train the next generation of pathologists: it's technology has enabled experts at the University of Nebraska to connect with researchers in Mumbai, patients in Kenya gained access to renowned pathology experts in Canada, and in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, patients gained access to pathologists at the University of Miami through telepathology.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In most developing countries, the effectiveness and sustainability of healthcare interventions strongly depends on local implementation capabilities. In their day-to-day work, healthcare professionals often have to take on management and leadership responsibilities in addition to a wide range of clinical duties. The combination of a lack of preparation for management and leadership tasks and a general scarcity of healthcare professionals contributes to poor health outcomes for communities.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
With a $4 million commitment from MSD's Merck Foundation, the BroadReach Institute for Training and Education (BRITE) is implementing its Management and Leadership Academy (MLA) program in Zambia. Zambia was identified as a country with a need for improved management and leadership skills among healthcare professionals in order to help build and strengthen the capacity of their local health systems. Through the MLA program, BRITE and its partners aims  to conduct training for healthcare professionals in all nine provinces of Zambia, across 27 target districts.
The MLA program helps equip healthcare workers with the knowledge and skills to lead, own and transform the delivery of healthcare in their own country, resulting in improved care and saved lives. MLA teaches results-based management and focuses on solving current challenges facing healthcare workers by combining on-site workshops with case studies and extensive mentoring of program participants.
BRITE is also working with Abt Associates in implementing the MLA program and is receiving additional support under the USAID-funded Zambia Integrated Systems Strengthening Program (ZISSP). BRITE and ZISSP are working in close partnership with the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) in Zambia to support the Ministry's ongoing efforts to develop management and leadership capacity at different levels of the health system.
The MLA approach is based on prior BroadReach Healthcare experiences in Botswana, Ethiopia and South Africa and teaches the practical application of acquired management and leadership skills to real-life issues and ultimately enables the transfer of skills to the work context in a sustainable manner. The combination of trainings, case studies and mentorship sessions helps participants in their day-to-day duties while also preparing them for the practical implementation of future programs and initiatives.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since its launch in 2011, the MLA program in Zambia has enrolled a total of 646 participants.  To date, almost 60 percent (379) of these participants have graduated, completing the four workshops in the MLA training series.  Of these 379 graduates, approximately 47 percent (177) graduated with accredited higher diplomas in management and leadership from the National Institute of Public Administration, which has led to national recognition of the MLA program.  The MLA certificate, and in particular, the NIPA Diploma, is an accredited health professional qualification that counts toward promotion within the civil service.
BRITE is assessing the MLA program effectiveness and outcomes through both qualitative and quantitative methods.  Through their program evaluation efforts, BRITE aims to assess the impact of MLA training on health workers’ management and leadership knowledge, skills and practices as well as the impact on services delivery.

Preventing communicable diseases as well as non-communicable diseases requires public awareness and understanding of the disease, risk factors and symptoms. Awareness raising is key, particularly in low and middle income countries, and advice and information must be clear and easily accessible. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) engages in healthcare-supporting activities, such as human resources development and capacity building through training and education in several projects around the world.
For instance, in Burundi, BI is involved in training pharmaceutical and technical assistants at the Tanganyika Paramedical School, Bujumbura. By leveraging BI internal resources and know-how, 18 PTAs were qualified in 2012 and 8 in 2013, with a target of 20 per year. A second pillar of the BI’s initiatives in Burundi is the set-up of a local production plant to secure availability of essential medicines in Burundi, with laboratory technical equipment from BI.
In South Africa, BI is committed to addressing the medical skills shortage by providing full financial aid for the medical studies of talented young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Through its 'Student Education Program', run in collaboration with the University of Cape Town, South Africa, Boehringer Ingelheim provides full financial support for medical students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Sponsorship includes all academic fees, subsistence allowances, books, equipment and residence fees (where applicable) for the duration of their seven-year studies with no obligation to the company after graduation. Each year, two additional students join the program.
To learn more about Boehringer Ingelheim in South Africa click here.
In Brazil, BI has set up a continued education program for pharmacists and pharmacy clerks to address shortcomings in staffing or preparation. Half of the 97 thousand Brazilian pharmacies and drugstores operate irregularly, without a technician in charge full time. In most cases, the pharmacist is not available during certain hours of the day, but 10% do not even have on the payroll a pharmacist working daily. The program set up is a free on-line course composed of 12 study models, geared to pharmacy clerks, pharmacists and Pharmacy college students in all the Brazilian territory. The purpose of the project is to qualify professionals for a better servicing to patients in pharmacies and drugstores. At the end of the program, those participants who access the content monthly and who answer correctly the questions asked, receive a certificate of ""Pharmaceutical Services Technician"", with the seal of the Federal Pharmacy Council (CFF). The pharmacies that had at least 80% of their professionals certified in the program, received acknowledgement by the CFF for good pharmaceutical servicing practices, through the Green Cross seal, which is an internationally acknowledged entity.

The investigational vaccine is designed to help protect at-risk individuals from C. diff, which is emerging as a leading cause of life-threatening, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) worldwide. While not antibiotic resistant itself, C. difficile is strongly associated with antibiotic use and preventing CDI could have a significant impact on the development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms.

Hospital-acquired infections are a major concern for public health in many industrialized countries and cause significant annual costs to the healthcare systems. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a potentially life-threatening, spore-forming bacterium that causes intestinal disease. The risk of contracting CDI increases with age, antibiotic treatment and time spent in hospitals or nursing homes, where multiple cases can lead to outbreaks. A main source of C. diff is infected patients who release spores into the environment that can then infect other people. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi Pasteur's candidate vaccine against Clostridium difficile takes a toxoid-based approach, which has been used extensively in Sanofi Pasteur's licensed vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). In August 2013, the company initiated a Phase III clinical program called Cdiffense to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of its investigational vaccine for the prevention of primary symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The Cdiffense Phase III clinical program will include up to 15,000 adults at 200 sites across 17 countries.
In addition to developing a C. difficile vaccine that could help reduce the burden of CDI in the world today, Sanofi Pasteur is working with multiple external experts to quantify the potential benefits of preventing CDI as it relates to the development and transmission of AMR organisms.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
There is an enormous deficit in the capacity for cancer management in Kenya, thus the majority of patients present in advanced stages when nothing much can be done. Kenya has only one public cancer treatment centre in Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) managed by four cancer specialists, with associated inadequate supplies of chemotherapy drugs and palliative care services.
Moi Teaching and Referral hospital (MTRH) runs a chemotherapy centre and has three cancer specialists.
There are three private cancer treatment centres in Nairobi with six linear accelerators and more than five cancer specialists but unfortunately these private facilities are unaffordable to majority of Kenyans.
In addition to the infrastructure challenges, the current training curriculum for primary health care providers does not have specific modules in cancer management such as cancer screening, early diagnosis, timely referral and palliative care.
With the rise of cancer in countries with a limited oncology community, it is critical that cancer control and cancer care collaboration be exercised at all sectors of the healthcare system.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Each course offered will train 20 primary health care providers, which will include medical officers, clinical officers and nurses chosen by the county governments
Training the primary health care providers in the community will positively impact early detection, early referrals, cancer screening and continuous patient education. They will also impact on patient follow up during, while on and after cancer treatment, especially for the majority of patients who are from rural areas.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
This course provides primary care professionals with practical and specific knowledge of oncology that can be put into their daily practice to improve cancer care. This will translate into timely diagnosis, referral and effective management.
Measurement of progress towards objectives
A critical outcome will be providing HCPs in the most rural areas the ability to recognise the early warning signs for different types of cancers, and to help their patients suspected of having cancer.
With over 40 000 new cancer cases in Kenya per year alone, and cancer expected to increase by 85% by 2030, the impact will be significant.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The majority of the 422 million people living with diabetes worldwide are aged between 40 and 59, and 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries. The number of people with diabetes is expected to increase by 55% by 2035; in Africa by 109% by 2035.  The proportion of cases of diabetes (20-79 years) that remain undiagnosed in Africa is 62%. According to IDF 2015 estimates, about 75% of the people with diabetes live in LMICs. 
People with type 2 diabetes can remain undiagnosed for many years, unaware of the long-term damage being caused by the disease. Poorly managed diabetes leads to serious complications and early death; diabetes caused 5.0 million deaths in 2015.
Diabetes is a huge and growing problem and the costs to society are high and escalating. IDF 2015 Atlas suggests that the estimated number of people with diabetes in the Africa Region is between 9.5 million and 29.3 million. The report also highlights that three quarters of these are estimated to be undiagnosed, constituting the highest undiagnosed figure among other IDF regions.
Africa accounts for less than 1% of global health expenditure on diabetes. Moreover, this region faces further challenges resulting from the limited number of trained health workers who can help patients with prevention, diagnosis and care.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Merck is collaborating with ministries of health, universities and local diabetes associations across 5 African countreis (Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, Mozambique and India) and expanded to Asia in 2015. It aims to raise diabetes awareness in Africa by educating the public and supporting the healthcare system on ways to prevent, diagnose and manage diabetes effectively.

Since 2011, Celgene Global Health (CGH) and DNDi have collaborated on the screening of CGH’s compound library for activity against NTDs.
In 2014, this collaboration was expanded towards the identification and optimization of potential therapeutic candidates for several of the world’s most neglected diseases, including leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, river blindness, and elephantiasis.
The Research Collaboration Agreement established between the two partners focuses on the lead optimization stage of research, with CGH providing novel compounds of interest for the targeted diseases and using its target-identification and drug-discovery technology platforms to progress these compounds up to identification of clinical candidates. DNDi will take the lead on hit confirmation and coordinate and conduct hit expansion, hit-to-lead compound work, and subsequent lead optimization work.
The agreement ensures that the result of the joint research enables DNDi to operate within the scope of neglected communicable diseases and in all endemic countries without the need to pay royalties or license fees. Celgene has the right of first negotiation to become DNDi’s clinical development, manufacture and distribution partner and commits to support broad access to patients in need in endemic countries.
In June 2016, Celgene became the fifth company to join the ‘Negelcted Tropicla Diseases Drug Discovery Booster’ consortium, an initiative set up one year before that aims to accelerate and cut the cost of early stage drug discovery for leishmaniosis and Chagas disease.

“In Kenya, cancer ranks third as a cause of death after infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases. It causes 7% of total national morality every year. Although population based data does not exist in the country, it is estimated that the annual incidence of cancer is about 28,000 cases and the annual mortality to be over 22,000. Over 60% of those affected are below the age of 70 years. In Kenya, the risk of getting cancer before the age of 75 years is 14% while the risk of dying of cancer is estimated at 12%. In many developing countries, the rapid rise in cancers and other non-communicable diseases has resulted from increased exposure to risk factors which include tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and exposure to environmental carcinogens. Other risk factors for some cancers include infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS (Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphomas), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Hepatitis B & C (Liver cancer), bacterial infections such as Helicobacter Pylori (cancer of stomach) and parasitic infestations such as schistosomiasis (cancer of bladder).” IPRC, Kenya National Cancer Control strategy
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2011, Celgene has collaborated with the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) and its partners to deliver health services, conduct health research and develop leaders in healthcare. The support of Celgene and other key donors has allowed a dramatic expansion of services through the AMPATH-Oncology Institute (AOI). This effort is focused on the development of a sustainable and comprehensive academic clinical care cancer program serving the 20 million citizens of western Kenya and neighboring areas.  Nearly 20,000 patient visits to AMPATH-Oncology occur each year with approximately 15,000-20,000 women also being screened for breast and cervical cancers. To date more than 100,000 women have been screened for these two cancers that have the highest morbidity and mortality. 
Organizationally, the AOI has four Clinical Pillars:
Screening & Prevention - Key elements include building a screening infrastructure, as well as education of practitioners and at-risk populations. 
Diagnosis & Treatment - Currently, the AOI prioritizes diagnosis and treatment programs by those diseases with highest impact on quality of life and lost life-years.
Palliative Care – With the majority of patients presenting with very late-stage disease with the constraints inherent in the resource-limited setting, a major focus is expansion of an effective palliative care program.
Survivorship Care – As the program grows, providing survivorship care for the increasing number of patients completing their adjuvant treatments and on routine follow-ups. 
Celgene’s support of the AMPATH Oncology Institute has enabled the creation of a successful multiple myeloma program, the first and only in Kenya. 
The AMPATH MM program conducts extensive patient and family education; it held 10 patient support group meetings over the course of 2015 and supported the care of 61 new patients with MM. The program has conducted multiple Continuing Medical Education (CMEs) on Multiple Myeloma per quarter and has expanded its reach to 12 outreach sites and other sites in Western Kenya. Celgene has also supported the establishment of a robust Oncology Pharmacist-led MM pharmacovigilance program and funded IT support for the development of electronic medical records for the MM program with decision support. 
In addition to the MM program, Celgene is also providing robust assistance to AMPATH’s pharmacy infrastructure and novel patient care strategies - including expansion of the: anti-coagulation program, the Learning to Care program - From Apathy to EMPATHE program and the counterfeit medication detection program into Tanzania. In addition, Celgene provides support for education for patients with hematologic disorders, pharmaceutical supply chain enhancement, infrastructure support, and the development of a pharmacy residency training program.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Celgene’s support of the AMPATH Oncology Institute has enabled the creation of a successful multiple myeloma program, the first and only in Kenya.  Achievements include: 
Developed safety pamphlets and materials for both patients and healthcare professionals for MM in Kenya.
Diagnostic improvements led to an increase from 5 patients diagnosed with MM in 2010 to 61 new patients in 2015. The expected number of new MM diagnoses in the country is about 800/year.
Approximately 100 MM patients are seen during routine clinic follow-up visits.
AMPATH-MM Program is currently seeking IRB approval for a 5-year retrospective data-driven study to demonstrate the feasibility of MM care with comparable outcomes in a resource poor country to more advanced settings.
Additional acheivements include:
1) Establishment of the College of Oncology of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa (CO-ECSA) in 2016 to help regulate and improve cancer care in the region. The proposed purpose of the college will be to: 
Ensure that certified specialists have sufficient knowledge of their specialty to practice safely and competently as consultants within the region. 
Complement workplace-based assessments on excellence in care, safety, and professionalism. 
Provide a rigorous regional assessment to establish public confidence. 
Offer a challenge similar to subspecialty certification examination in developed countries. 
Participate in the accreditation of Sponsoring Institutions, masters and fellowship programs in cancer care.
2) Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital is embarking on establishing itself as a clinical pharmacy center of excellence where pharmacists will be deployed to all the high volume wards in the hospital to provide clinical pharmacy services as opposed to occupying their traditional dispensing role.
3) Anticoagulation care has expanded to serve over 2,300 patients.
4) Increase in numbers of permanently hired testing counselors available for patient care. In just one month, this enhanced testing as a result of Celgene sponsored programs resulted in a 60% increase in the numbers of HIV-infected patients identified on the wards.
Measurement of progress towards objectives 
Estimated overall value of partnership: 
$1.9 million
Estimated amount of people impacted: 
Nearly 20,000 patient visits to AMPATH-Oncology occur each year with approximately 15,000-20,000 women also being screened for breast and cervical cancers. To date, more than 100,000 women have been screened for these two cancers that have the highest morbidity and mortality.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Childhood diabetes has a high mortality rate in developing/poor countries. The life expectancy for a child with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa is typically less than one year.
The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that there are 542,000 children under the age of 15 years with type 1 diabetes in the world; around half of them live in developing countries. 
For a family in a developing country, having a child diagnosed with diabetes can bring an overwhelming financial and emotional burden.
In many countries access to appropriate diabetes care, insulin and supplies can be limited and this may lead to severe handicap and early death in children with diabetes.
Urgent action is needed to improve the conditions for children with diabetes in the developing countries.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Changing Diabetes® in Children (CDiC) program is working with local partners in each country to provide care for children with type 1 diabetes and to help strengthen overall capacity.
The CDiC program was established in 2009 by Novo Nordisk as a multi-partner initiative also supported by the World Diabetes Foundation, Roche and ISPAD. Other project partners include patient organizations, key opinion leaders, health ministries and local governments.
The Changing Diabetes® in Children program has worked in partnership to establish clinics where children with diabetes can be diagnosed and receive specialised care.
The program trains healthcare professionals about diagnosis and treatment, and educates patients and families about the life of a child with diabetes.
To overcome financial hurdles, the program entails the free provision of insulin and blood glucose measuring equipment for the children, for the duration of the program.
The program builds long-term solutions for improving availability, accessibility, affordability and quality of diabetes care for children with type 1 diabetes.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The program takes place in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. In 2016, more than 8,360 children have been registered into the programme involving 90 clinics with 3,919 trained healthcare workers. The programme includes the supply of Roche glucometers and strips, Novo Nordisks human insulin, as well as training the workers in diabetes management. 
Patient education materials have been developed in English, French, Amharic, Swahili and Spanish and are freely available on the Novo Nordisk website. A basic training manual for health care professionals on type 1 diabetes in children has been developed along with patient portrait films and they are freely available. And an electronic patient registry has been developed and distributed.
In November 2016, Novo Nordisk announced the expansion of the programme up to 2020, which entails expanding to five new countries with an ambition of reaching 20,000 children. Roche is also committed to continue its support up until 2020 in ten African countries. Read the press release here.

Reduce morbidity in school-age children infected or at risk of infection with soil-transmitted helminths (STH - intestinal worms including roundworm, whipworm and hookworm).
Partner with global health stakeholders to implement programs that prevent the cycle of worm transmission through promotion of hygiene education and access to clean water and improved sanitation.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Many diseases disproportionately affect women and children in the developing world, and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) is one of them.
Although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that STH infections cause as many as 135,000 deaths a year, the greatest public health significance is the chronic and disabling effects of these infections. Effects include abdominal pain and distension, intestinal obstruction, iron-deficiency anemia, increased susceptibility to other serious infections, stunted growth and impaired cognitive development in children. Ultimately, these conditions may have socio-economic consequences such as poor school performance in children, which in turn leads to decreased labor productivity when these children become adults.
Over 267 million preschool-age children and over 568 million school-age children are infected with intestinal worms. According to the WHO, in 2010, only about 30% are receiving treatment. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Children Without Worms (CWW) has a mission of enhancing the health and development of children by reducing intestinal worm infections through its work in country support, partnerships and advocacy, knowledge management, and technical and scientific collaboration.
CWW advocates for a comprehensive strategy to break the cycle of reinfection with soil-transmitted helminths, referred to as the four-component strategy—Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Education and Deworming—the WASHED Framework.
Water – access to clean water for hand washing and the cleaning of food minimizes reinfection
Sanitation – latrines and other improved sanitation facilities keep infected human excretions from the areas where people live, work and play, further minimizing the risk of re-infection in treated individuals and preventing new infections.
Hygiene education – promoting personal and environmental hygiene in communities reduces the risk of re-infection of treated individuals and prevents new infections.
Deworming – treatment with broad spectrum antihelmintic drugs like VERMOX™ and albendazole kills intestinal worms in infected individuals, thereby reducing the morbidity caused by high worm burden. Reducing the number of individuals with high-intensity infections will reduce the spread of the infection.
With increased drug donations, there needs to be a systematic means to allocate the medicines, assist countries in developing the capacity to administer the treatment programs, and subsequently monitor the progress and health impact. Children Without Worms (CWW) serves as the secretariat to the program to ensure that the objectives of the program are being met. Project partners include the Ministries of Health and Ministries of Education of recipient countries. CWW also works with these governmental agencies to identify in-country, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to institute hygiene education in regular curricula and to install and maintain water and sanitation facilities.
Working with multiple countries comes with challenges unique to individual countries and are addressed on a case-by-case basis. CWW is the secretariat to the STH Advisory Committee, which has representatives from academia, global health authorities (including the WHO), health economists, epidemiologists, country program managers and government ministries. Key issues are addressed and discussed at this level, and plans of action are developed. In executing solutions, country ministries and program managers are integrally involved because of the need to ensure country ownership.
Lessons learned
The medicines to treat intestinal worms made available from both J&J and GSK are only one part of the solution. Inclusion of hygiene education and clean water and adequate sanitation are key to preventing transmission and re-infection of STH. If these issues are not addressed, treatment will need to be carried out in perpetuity. With the renewed commitments on NTDs as they relate to achieving the MDGs, there is a need to develop collaborations with those involved in WATSAN and infrastructure development.
The funding for NTDs, especially for the control of STH, is never guaranteed. It is critical to be vigilant in advocating for continued support of the program from year to year. It does not have the visibility of other major diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. However, the morbidity due to high intensity of infection is no less debilitating; robbing chronic sufferers from a quality of life and subsequently, a productive livelihood. The DALYs lost, a measure of disease burden, from chronic infections is significant and relegates communities and populations to a vicious cycle of poverty.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To date, Johnson & Johnson has donated more than 1 billion doses of mebendazole and plans to donate up to 200 million doses each year through 2020 as part of its commitment to London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).  Together with a major annual donation of albendazole by GSK, this donation program has had a major impact on providing treatment to over 75% of the 870 million at risk children targeted by the WHO. 
In October 2016, the U.S. FDA approved VERMOXTM CHEWABLE (mebendazole chewable 500mg tablets) for the treatment of patients one year of age and older with gastrointestinal infections caused by Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) and Trichuris trichiura(whipworm). Following the FDA approval and eventual WHO prequalification of the VERMOXTM CHEWABLE tablet, Johnson & Johnson plans to include the chewable version in its donation program to help reduce the burden of intestinal worms, or soil-transmitted helminths (STH), in endemic countries.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Xinjiang is a high-prevalence area of chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease, as well as infectious diseases like hepatitis B. There are a lot of underdeveloped areas where residents are not well educated when it comes to their health. These areas are also faced with increased healthcare demands, inefficient use of healthcare resources, and unsatisfying implementation of disease management guidelines. Local rural residents lack basic health knowledge; local rural doctors lack systematic training. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The JKKC project is well-recognized by the local government, residents and the media. Since its launch in 2010, the program has covered more than 90% of Xinjiang’s rural areas, and provided health education to 1,800,000 students, 470,000 residents and 60,000 doctors. Student education has a positive “ripple effect” as students pass on the knowledge they acquire to their families and thus influence health behaviors in local communities.
JKKC will keep focusing on “Winning for Patients” and “Commitment to Sustainable Success” in Xinjiang and will look to expand through Western China in the future. The program will continue to provide systematic training and help the development of local healthcare.
In 2017, 100,000 students, 250,000 residents and 30,000doctors are expected to be trained.
Since launch, JKKC has received a number of international and domestic awards.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
China has the largest population of diabetics in the world and is confronted with a real epidemic of the disease. However, the direct treatment of Type 2 diabetes and its complications in urban China only amounts to 3.94% of the total amount of health budget. In addition, according to the International Diabetes Federation, one in two adults with diabetes is undiagnosed and unaware of their disease.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
As a pioneer in the field of diabetes, Sanofi supports a number of initiatives in China. The China Initiative for Diabetes Excellence (CIDE) program is a five-year disease management program led by the Chinese Heath Ministry. This strong public-private partnership between Sanofi and the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS), the Centre of Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center at the International Diabetes Center intends to provide diabetic patients with the best care possible, by providing world-class clinical and research training programs. 
The program rolls out in several phases:
Promote the capability development of young Chinese endocrinology experts by conveying basic notions of public health and reinforcing their capacity to collaborate with local doctors in providing the best possible health care to diabetic patients.
Train community and county doctors to give them the skills needed to optimize resources on the ground.  
Additionally train CDC staff at provincial level and regional level to enhance their understanding about Chinese diabetes prevention and management.
This program shows that there is a need to provide a high level educational programs in a country where the incidence and prevalence of diabetes in growing. Scientific exchanges through this program has shown that positive capacity building and transfers of knowledge could be achieved successfully in this country. 
Over the past five years, CIDE :
1, Strengthened international exchanges and introduced the concept of international advanced IDC clinical treatment concept to China.
2, Improved the level of diagnosis and treatment of professional doctors in the field of diabetes in China, including doctors of the top city hospitals, as well as basic level hospital (county level hospitals) of the general practitioner
3, Helped public health management officials (CDC) to improve the awareness of chronic disease management, and published the chronic disease management guidelines for public health at all levels in the country, promoting in CDC level. 
This was achieved through the training of over 450 young Chinese experts in endocrinology, about 25000 county and community doctors, about 140 CDC staff at provincial level and 2500 CDC staff at regional level. In addition, 50 Chinese endocrinology experts were sent to IDC and Mayo Clinic for exchange and learning.

In partnership with The Max Foundation, this direct-to-patient access program has provided treatment to approximately 75 000 people since its inception.
In 2017, Novartis announced the transition of this partnership to a new program called CMLPath to Care™, which aims to support continued access to treatment at no cost for the nearly 34 000 previously registered patients in GIPAP with CML, GIST and other rare cancers.
CMLPath to Care™ provides Glivec at no cost to patients who would not otherwise have access to treatment. The program also provides patients with access to support groups, treatment and disease information, education and emotional support to help manage their illness.
The goal is to help people living with CML, GIST and other rare cancers by connecting them and their care givers with effective treatment, professional medical capabilities, trained physicians and hands-on support – based on GIPAP learnings.
This will be an independent program within The Max Foundation, which will assume responsibility from Novartis for delivering treatment to these patients, including supply chain management. Novartis will provide funding and drug donation support.
The collaborative agreement for CMLPath to Care runs through the first quarter of 2021 with an option to extend it. During this period, Novartis expects to donate more than USD 29 million to the collaboration, along with approximately 315 million doses of medicine, and to evaluate further options to sustain the program after 2021. China has a stand-alone program that support close to 30,000 patients for little or no costs.
Early engagement with governments is essential to the success of a program of this size and ambition. Equally important is clarity on the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved along with standard operating procedures to standardize processes across many disparate countries. Education on the program for physicians, governments, patients, distributors and others involved is also crucial.
The impact of the program is especially significant where local health authorities and civil organizations work together to improve facilities and educate patients and their families, thereby providing resources to offer integrated patient care. The partnership is active in 68 low and middle-income counties.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Typhoid fever is a severe bacterial infection spread through water or food contaminated with human waste. The bacterium that causes typhoid fever is Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). The disease causes high fever, flu-like symptoms, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, rose-colored spots on the chest, and systemic illness that can result in severe morbidity or death. Typhoid fever impacts the lives of an estimated 21 million people a year, causing at least 200,000 deaths, predominantly among school-age and preschool-age children. The disease burden and global mortality rates from typhoid fever are comparable to other significant vaccine-preventable diseases, including rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib), and Hepatitis B. The disease is transmitted through the fecal-oral route and is most prevalent in areas without safe water and improved sanitation.
In many typhoid-high burden communities, reliable health care services, including accurate diagnostics and basic antibiotic medications, are limited. When healthcare services can be reached, low-cost, first-line antibiotics may not be effective.
Research indicates that multidrug resistant (MDR) typhoid strains have become increasingly common in typhoid-high burden communities, requiring new and more expensive antibiotics for treatment and increasing hospitalization rates for patients. Without appropriate antibiotic therapy, typhoid mortality can reach 20%. In 2014, 97% of typhoid cases resisted treatment from multiple drugs, an increase of 90% from 2010. 
Another issue affecting the treatment of typhoid is the lack of effective diagnostics. Delayed and inaccurate diagnosis and treatment result in increased costs and higher rates of serious complications and deaths. In many areas, typhoid fever is misdiagnosed as malaria, dengue, or pneumonia due to non-specific clinical symptoms. Currently, if left untreated, 20% of typhoid cases are fatal.
Prevention is key to stopping the cycle of typhoid transmission. Vaccines can help ward off typhoid infection in endemic environments, while improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure can help eliminate exposure to typhoid and paratyphoid bacteria. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
By increasing disease burden knowledge and awareness and raising visibility of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendations to countries and clarifying vaccination strategies, the Coalition against Typhoid (CaT) aims to prioritize typhoid on the global stage.
CaT is a global forum of scientists and immunization experts working to save lives and reduce suffering by advancing typhoid vaccination in high burden communities; populations affected by complex emergencies and natural disasters; and persons at risk for typhoid or its transmission as a result of their occupation or travel.
Activities of the CaT include:
Increasing typhoid fever awareness of the global, regional, and national epidemiology and disease burden
Promoting awareness of WHO’s recommendations on typhoid vaccination
Implement the typhoid vaccine in most endemic countries in 5-10 years
Encouraging GAVI’s prioritization of typhoid vaccines by providing data and modeling of disease burden and vaccination impact
Assisting countries to develop their vaccination strategies including: short term improvement such as good hygiene practices (eg. hand washing), long term improvements (eg. access to safe water and improved sanitation).
Securing adequate resources in to support all the activities above
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The Coalition against Typhoid attends and organizes multiple annual events and meetings to foster collaboration of CaT activities at regional, national and global levels. These events include the World Congress on Pediatric Infectious Diseases, the International Congress for Infectious Disease, the General Meeting of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufactures Network and series of meetings with the best modelling experts in the world to review typhoid burden estimates and vaccine impact models. 
CaT continues to expand the number of its partners and assist in the coordination of in-country implementation programs and monitoring of typhoid vaccination programs. 
On 2 March 2015, Novartis announced the completion of a series of transactions with GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), including the divestiture of the Novartis non-influenza Vaccines business to GSK.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The quality and availability of HIV diagnosis, care and treatment in PNG continues to be limited by severe resource shortages in the health system including lack of trained professionals and medical supplies to deliver basic health services. Misinformation and poor understanding about HIV has contributed to discriminatory attitudes toward people living with the virus, creating a hurdle to access health services. The shortage of skilled health workers mirrors the greater human resource challenge impacting on all service sectors in PNG.
An estimated 25,000 people were estimated to be living with HIV in 2012 in PNG with HIV prevalence being highest in the Highlands and Southern regions at 0.63% and 0.57% respectively. These figures reflect a downward revision of estimates from previous years, due in part to an improvement in the national surveillance systems but may also be suggestive of successful education, treatment and prevention programs.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership established the Collaboration for Health in Papua New Guinea (CHPNG), which works with relevant departments of the Government of PNG, the National Catholic AIDS Office in PNG the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine (ASHM) from Australia and the National Association for People Living with HIV/AIDS (NAPWA) from Australia in projects to build the local capacity of the people of PNG to fight the HIV epidemic. CHPNG activities include the provision of day care centers to provide a safe space for people living with HIV/AIDS and where their caregivers can meet and share experiences. It also undertakes the training of multidisciplinary teams of nearly 400 healthcare workers to manage HIV and provides an ongoing education and mentoring program to maintain and improve the skills of those providing care. The mentor program has allowed the PNG healthcare workers to meet with their Australian counterparts to sharpen their skills, bolster their confidence and provide a network with which to discuss treatment options.
Lessons learned                             
The CHPNG has learned that by supporting those already committed – no matter how modest, an effective national program can be built through a local response.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The CHPNG has been operating with partners in Australia and PNG since 2003 and has moved from training in workshops by geographical teams to supporting lessons learned through mentors from Australia who visit centers and assist in clinics. In the future, it is hoped that the mentors will be taken from a pool of PNG healthcare professionals who are able to visit and support their neighbors. Clinical mentoring will continue to be the primary focus of the program, but will be adapted to include STIs, in order to meet the growing need to address STIs across all sites.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The unmet need for contraception remains high. An estimated 225 million women in developing countries would like to delay or prevent pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception[i]. Common reasons for this include difficulty travelling to health facilities, social barriers, and lack of knowledge around what contraceptive methods are available[ii].
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
Sayana Press combines a longer-acting, reversible contraceptive with the BD Uniject™ injection system developed by BD. This all-in-one prefilled, single-use, auto-disable system eliminates the need to prepare a needle and syringe. It also allows the contraceptive to be administered by a health worker outside of a clinical setting, or it can be self-injected if approved locally and after health care worker instruction. The extension of their collaboration produced a 6 year agreement, during which the price is guaranteed at $0.85. After then, Pfizer is committed to making Sayana Press affordable. 

These public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations play an important role to help ensure that women in the world’s poorest countries have access to a full range of contraceptive options. In addition to assisting with procurement, these organizations support country introductions and the delivery of a range of high quality modern contraceptive options, including subcutaneous injectable contraceptives. At the country level, the organizations also work with local governments with the goal of including modern contraceptives in reproductive health plans and budgets, coordinating health-worker trainings to improve quality counselling and services, and raising awareness about the availability of a variety of modern contraceptive options. 
Partner Involvement
Additional collaborators supporting efforts to increase access to a full range of modern contraceptives include public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations such as United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). BD (Becton, Dickinson & Company) is the manufacturer of the delivery system.
The public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations supporting this effort to increase access to a full range of contraceptives first collaborated in 2014 to assess demand for subcutaneous injectable options, including Pfizer’s all-in-one injectable contraceptive, Sayana® Press (medroxyprogesterone acetate) for women most in need in some of the world’s poorest countries. In 2017, Pfizer Inc., the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation announced a multi-year extension of their collaboration to further broaden access to Sayana Press. Sayana Press will now be available to qualified purchasers at a guaranteed price of US $0.85 per dose, a reduction from the previous price of US $1.00 per dose.
List of countries involved
Some of the world’s poorest countries, including countries outlined in FP2020 a global collaboration to help ensure that by 2020, an additional 120 million women have the ability to access and voluntarily use a method of modern contraception.
Lessons learned

The public- and private-sector donors and aid organizations first collaborated in 2014 to assess demand for subcutaneous injectable contraceptives, including Sayana Press. Initial pilots conducted in Niger, Senegal and Uganda demonstrated strong demand for subcutaneous inectable contraceptives among younger women: up to 34 percent of doses administered across these three countries were to women between the ages of 20 and 24. Sayana Press is also attracting women who have never before used contraceptives, with 24- 42% of doses given across the pilots received by new users of family planning. [iii]
By working together to expand the range of contraceptive options available, more women in more countries have had access to them, including Sayana Press every year. 

Summary of impact and forward looking information
By the end of 2016, 6.4 million units of Sayana Press were shipped to 20 developing world countries, potentially reaching more than 1.5 million women – up from 350,000 women at the end of 2014[iv]. Pfizer is continuing to make investments in its manufacturing facilities to meet the expected increase in market demand.  
Measurement of progress towards objectives 
Estimated overall value of partnership: Sayana Press will now be available to qualified purchasers at a guaranteed price of US $0.85 per dose, a reduction from the previous price of US $1.00 per dose.
Estimated amount of people impacted: By the end of 2016, 6.4 million units of Sayana Press were shipped to 20 developing world countries, potentially reaching more than 1.5 million women

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) causes typhoid fever and is a significant public health problem in developing countries where access to clean water and proper sanitation is limited and causes over 21 million cases and over 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. S. Paratyphi A causes a clinically similar disease (paratyphoid fever) and is reported to cause five million cases in a year.
Given limitations of current typhoid vaccines and increasing antibiotic drug resistance of the bacteria, there is an urgent need for effective vaccines. Many victims of these diseases are children under the age of two for whom there is no widely available typhoid vaccine, while no vaccine is available for any age group against paratyphoid fever.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Novartis has entered into a development and licensing agreement with Biological E Limited (BioE), a biopharmaceutical company based in India, for two vaccines to protect against typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. The agreement advances the Novartis goal to deliver accessible and affordable vaccines that address unmet medical need in endemic regions.
Under the license, NVGH will transfer technology to BioE, which will have financial and operational responsibility for manufacturing, further clinical development, approval and distribution in the developing world.  The typhoid vaccine (Vi-CRM197) has achieved Proof of Concept, had successful Phase 2 results, and will be transferred to BioE. A combined typhoid-paratyphoid vaccine will be transferred once Proof of Concept is completed through early, small-scale studies in humans to determine safety and immunogenicity.
In addition, a dual-acting vaccine with components against both typhoid and paratyphoid fevers is being developed with on-going support from the Wellcome Trust. Both could reduce the burden of these diseases in endemic regions.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The typhoid vaccine (Vi-CRM197) has achieved successful clinical proof-of-concept and Phase 2 clinical trials and is now in the process of being transferred to BioE. A combined typhoid-paratyphoid vaccine that is still undergoing testing at NVGH will be transferred to BioE once clinical proof-of-concept will be completed through early, small-scale human studies to determine safety and immunogenicity.
On 2 March 2015, Novartis announced the completion of a series of transactions with GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), including the divestiture of the Novartis non-influenza Vaccines business to GSK.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Chagas’ disease is endemic in 21 countries across Latin America and kills more people in the region than any other parasite-borne disease, including malaria. More than 25 million people are at risk worldwide most of whom are living in Latin America, and patient numbers are also growing in non-endemic countries such as the United States and Australia, as well as in some European countries. The disease is transmitted by an insect known as the ‘kissing bug’ and, without treatment, is potentially fatal. Existing treatments are known to have serious safety limitations and their efficacy diminishes the longer the patient has been infected. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In April 2016, Astellas signed a new collaborative research agreement with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) to discover Anti-protozoan parasite drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease, one of Neglected Tropical Diseases. Since 2012, Astellas has been collaborative with five research institutions in Japan as well as with an international non-profit organization to discover new drugs for the treatment of NTDs caused by protozoan parasites belonging to trypanosomatidae. By utilizing the knowledge obtained through this collaborative research, Astellas and AIST will now pursue collaborative research to discover new drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease.
Under this collaborative research agreement, Astellas and AIST will work together to validate whether genes crucial for the survival of Trypanosoma cruzi can be pinpointed in a short period of time by using gene editing technology. Astellas will mainly be responsible for selecting appropriate genes to be verified, and AIST will lead the gene editing process.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In case this approach is validated, the formation of AIST-driven research consortium, in which multiple research institutions will participate to conduct extensive genome editing studies on the genes of Trypanosoma cruizi and pursue discovery of new drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease in a larger framework, is planned. Astellas also plans to consider joining the consortium.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Cancer is one of the greatest health challenges of our time, and a leading cause of death in every corner of the world. Without preventative measures, the disproportionate majority of mortality from cancer will occur in low-and middle-income countries where there is limited availability of screening, early detection and access to treatment.  Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in Kenya and the leading cause of cancer in women. Every year approximately 4,500 patients are diagnosed with the disease and 2,000 patients lose their lives to this disease. Although it occurs in both men and women, more than 90 percent of the cases present in women, with more than 50 percent of the cases presenting in women below the age of 50. This places their families and the economy at a great disadvantage. Early diagnosis and treatment could greatly reduce the burden of breast cancer and improve treatment outcomes.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In August 2016, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, the Kenyan Ministry of Health and Roche launched a public-private partnership to strengthen initiatives to combat cancer in Kenya. This is the first of two memorandums of understandings Roche has signed in Kenya. The second, with the newly Beth Mugo Cancer Foundation, was signed in October 2016.
Access to medicine will be made available to patients seeking treatment at public institutions with the government of Kenya and Roche jointly covering the costs. The aim is to ensure breast cancer patients have access to timely diagnostic services and tailored cancer treatment to make cancer therapy much more effective. Planned activities for the public-private partnership with the Ministry of Health include breast cancer awareness programs, strengthening screening and diagnostics, training new oncologists and oncology nurses, supporting development of best practice national treatment guidelines and increasing the number of cancer treatment centers in Kenya. 
“This partnership between the Government of Kenya and Roche demonstrates that we all must play our part to ensure that our mothers, sisters and daughters have the opportunity to fight and win the war against breast cancer.” First Lady Margaret Kenyatta
The launch builds on the country’s 2015-2020 National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases and represents a comprehensive approach to battling the disease. The program also complements the campaign from the African First Ladies who are committed to expanding access to prevention and treatment services for women with breast cancer.
 “This comprehensive agreement ensures that breast cancer patients in Kenya will have not only improved access to care and life-changing medicines, but also that the overall healthcare system is stronger to support all Kenyans battling cancer.” Markus Gemuend, Head of Roche Sub-Saharan Africa.
Roche is developing similar programs in other sub-Saharan African countries, such as Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan, Côte d’Ivoire and Gabon. Based on country needs and capabilities, Roche is implementing a wide selection of activities in collaboration with local partners, including healthcare system strengthening, such as local data generation and advocacy for healthcare prioritisation; disease management support, such as awareness, advocacy campaigns and healthcare professional education, along with innovative pricing solutions such as developing private health insurance with local companies and differential price agreements with governments.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Microbicides are compounds that can be applied directly to the vagina or rectum prior to sexual intercourse in order to prevent the transmission of HIV. They can come in the form of a gel, cream, or in a slow release device.
The vast majority of new HIV infections are through sexual contact; therefore, the key to slowing the HIV epidemic is to prevent sexual transmission of HIV. Condoms remain the most effective way of stopping sexually transmitted HIV; however, despite widespread efforts to encourage condom use, many people do not have the power to avoid sexual contact with partners who may be HIV infected. This is particularly the case for women who may not have the ability to control their sexual interactions with men and safeguard their own sexual health. Microbicides have the potential to give more power to individuals to protect themselves against HIV.
To date, no microbicide has been approved for use but there is a considerable research effort worldwide to develop microbicides. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Combined Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Microbicides (CHAARM) is a large scale collaborative project co-funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) for Research and Technological Development. CHAARM is a consortium of 31 partners from academic institutions, research organizations, small and medium enterprises, and larger industries, representing 9 different countries in Europe including Ukraine, as well as South Africa and the U.S. The project will run for 5 years beginning in January 2010 and ending in December 2014 and the project coordinator is King’s College, London.
Pharmaceutical partners include Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and Gilead. Janssen is providing darunavir, a protease inhibitor, to the consortium for evaluation as a potential microbicide in combination with dapivirine, another Janssen molecule. Janssen has provided additional resources to develop a formulation and to procure GMP material containing both ARVs for a phase I clinical study. By combining two antiretrovirals with different mechanisms of action, the team hopes to overcome possible resistance issues. The choice of the combination has also been validated in a selection algorithm containing in vitro studies and animal studies.  
Given the complexity and the high risk path for developing a new preventative tool in the fight against HIV/AIDS, it is difficult for pharmaceutical companies to fully engage. This collaborative project—which allows academia and pharmaceutical companies to join forces and the public sector to provide some funding—enables pharmaceutical companies to contribute to developing new HIV prevention tools because risks and liabilities are shared.  
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
Both a gel and a ring containing dapivirine and darunavir are available for testing in animals and in humans.
In December 2014, a six month extension was agreed to allow completion of the phase I trial of a combined Dapivirine and Darunavir vaginal gel. This extension has also allowed the testing of 3 further candidate microbicides developed under the project, in the non-human primate model.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Over the past 15 years, significant progress has been made against malaria. According to the latest WHO World Malaria Report, deaths have more than halved since 2000.
But more needs to be done.  Malaria continues to claim nearly half a million lives every year, most of them very young children in Africa. This preventable and treatable disease continues to take a heavy human and economic toll. In 2015 alone, there were 212 million new cases of malaria worldwide and an estimated 429 000 malaria deaths– 92% of which were in Africa.
The World Health Organization has set a target to cut malaria cases and deaths by at least 90% by 2030. This will take teamwork. So in 2015, Comic Relief and GSK joined forces in a five-year partnership to help strengthen health systems’ ability to fight malaria and improve people’s health in five malaria endemic countries.
This partnership builds on GSK’s longstanding commitments to fighting malaria on all fronts – from researching medicines and vaccines to supporting community prevention and education efforts.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
A new fund – created through a £17 million donation from GSK and £5 million from Comic Relief –will provide targeted grants to organisations on the frontline tackling malaria in Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and the Greater Mekong Sub Region.
These grants, made and managed by Comic Relief, will complement national malaria control programmes and help ensure people access prevention, diagnosis, and treatment at the right time and in the right place.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Heart disease is the deadliest chronic disease in the world. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries is a contributing factor. Migration from rural to urban areas is associated with increased blood pressure, the leading cause of heart disease. Healthcare services in these growing cities are struggling, and are swamped with ongoing challenges like infectious diseases. They have limited time or resources to tackle chronic diseases like high blood pressure, which are often without symptoms early on, yet can cause long-term damage.
Complications from hypertension and high blood pressure account for 9.4 million deaths worldwide every year. Nearly 25% of the adult population in Vietnam has hypertension, but less than half of them are aware of their condition. Of those diagnosed with hypertension, only 11% have it under control. In urban areas of Vietnam the prevalence of hypertension is higher at 33%, with Ho Chi Minh City being home to the largest urban population in the country.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2016, Novartis Foundation launched a hypertension management program in Vietnam, called “Communities for Healthy Hearts.” It is designed to improve the health of adults with high blood pressure living in low-income households in four districts in Ho Chi Minh City province, Vietnam’s largest urban area. The Novartis Foundation is collaborating with global nonprofit PATH, local partners and government agencies in Vietnam.
The Ho Chi Minh City program leverages the collective expertise of its partners to create an innovative healthcare model adapted to the needs of low-income patients. It does this by:
Using an awareness campaign to create a sense of urgency to generate demand and encourage people to take action
Strengthening treatment and referral services by collaborating with the public and private health sectors, as well as the local community
Partnering with social enterprises to improve blood pressure screening
Leveraging technology to help patients with high blood pressure manage their disease and adhere to their therapy

The World Health Organization estimates that the prevalence of hypertension in Ghana is 27.3%, one quarter of the country’s adult population. Despite this fact, few efforts have been made to ensure that hypertension is controlled, preventing the incidence of other health related diseases. In fact, it has been estimated that only 4.1% of hypertensive patients in Ghana control their hypertension. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Community-based Hypertension Improvement Project (ComHIP) is a three-year program designed to evaluate the impact of an innovative healthcare model on hypertension control and self-management in Ghana. Novartis works with its partners to develop hypertension awareness within the community, organize screening and diagnosis facilities outside the health system, improve skills for community nurses, and support self-management of hypertension by patients.
ComHIP shifts the patient’s point of access to care from the hospital, which is often distant and crowded, to the community. Local businesses and healthcare workers based in the community are trained to screen and care for hypertensive patients. 
In 2015, the screening for hypertension began in the Lower Manya Krobo District of the Eastern Region in Ghana.

Each year, approximately 300 000 women die during pregnancy, and childbirth. The risk of death for African women is 100 times higher than for women in high-income countries. Almost 2 million newly-born children die within 24 hours of birth. Most of these deaths could be  avoided if women, often poor and isolated, had access to well educated, qualified, well equipped and authorized midwives in their locality.
There is a need for 350,000 midwives worldwide.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Sanofi Espoir Foundation, together with the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), has set up a collaborative platform where midwives can trade experiences and share ideas, projects and innovations.
In addition, the Sanofi Espoir Foundation launched a call for proposals “Midwives for Life Awards” to fight against maternal and neonatal mortality in developing countries, particularly for the benefit of the poorest populations by strengthening the practice of midwives.
Any qualified midwife who belongs to a member association of the ICM can take part in this unique recognition program, provided that their project is intended to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and improve healthcare of the neediest women and their newborns.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
These 6 first selected projects, of this call for proposals, will have trained by 2015, 4,200 midwives in the following developing countries: Senegal & Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Burma, Cambodia, and Mexico and will help strengthen the health policies of these countries. These programs will be supported for a first three-year phase and will aim at increasing the number and skills of midwives by improving training conditions, working to retain them in their jobs, and assigning them to areas where the needs are greatest. For 2013, Sanofi allocated €2.5 million to this project.
The programs will also expand opportunities for midwives to network more effectively with other health professionals and community workers in towns or whole regions, and enable all partners to share resources and expertise so as to fight more intelligently for maternal health.

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), diabetes will affect over 500 million people worldwide in 2030. Developing countries will account for more than 76% of diabetics around the world. Africa will experience the world’s largest increase in diabetes between 2010 and 2030. Africa in 2030 will have over 23 million people with diabetes.
Africa is undergoing an epidemiological transition from communicable diseases to chronic noncommunicable diseases. The diabetes pandemic in Africa is due to:
The increasing age of its communities;
The rapid urbanization leading to a change in lifestyle, with a marked increase in sedentary activities, changes in nutrition, and the rapid increase of overweight people and obesity.
Difficulties to manage diabetes in Africa are mostly due to:
Difficult geographical and financial access to diabetes care, such as lack of medicines, consultation and analysis facilities, lack of trained health professionals to manage diabetes;
Lack of prevention programs;
Health systems which are not adapted to managing chronic diseases, and are focusing on priorities such as HIV, Malaria, Tuberculosis.
People with diabetes use twice as many health services as people without diabetes.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi Espoir Foundation partnered with the NGO Handicap International to fight diabetes through actions on the ground in support of the country’s Ministry of Health and local stakeholders involved in community awareness-raising, healthcare professionals training. These actions had the objective to improve detection and early management of patients, as well as rehabilitation of those affected by disabilities.
Following the initial pilot-project phase, Handicap International and Sanofi Espoir Foundation decided to continue their commitment to fight diabetes by stepping up the scale with three completed, consolidated projects aimed at changing health systems in recipient countries so that they can better respond to neglected needs.
In 2009, Sanofi Espoir Foundation participated in the publication of a Guide dedicated to NGOs in order to help them analyze needs and the diabetes situation in countries with limited resources.

Malaria killed more than 627,000 people in 2012, mainly in Africa. It is the third leading cause of mortality among African children and affects the ability of adults to work and children to go to school. And drugs alone are not enough to fight this disease. Training of healthcare professionals is essential to raise awareness and develop prevention involving doctors, field nurses and community health workers in local initiatives.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
With its malaria initiative, Sanofi-Access to Medicines has been committed since 2001 alongside partners in the field in the fight against malaria with a global offer combining accessible drugs and educational programs.
Sanofi-Access to Medicines has developed a comprehensive approach of the malaria disease management based on a four-fold approach:
Developing training tools and information and education initiatives that are adapted to all actors in the health chain.
Producing medicines designed to meet patients’ needs, making use of our industrial know-how.
Making medicines affordable for patients most in-need by applying a tiered pricing policy in endemic countries.
Establishing a research and development program dedicated to therapeutic innovation in order to meet the challenges of the future, in particular the development of resistance to existing medicines.
To support the National Malaria Control Programs (NMCPs) of African malaria-endemic countries, Sanofi has developed an innovative “Train the Trainers” program on malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Training materials have been developed with scientific experts and NMCPs. Training sessions are organized for NCMP or Non-Governmental Organizations staff. They are managed by African malaria experts and take place over several days. One day is devoted to communication techniques, enabling participants in the training program to learn how to pass down their knowledge, so that, in turn, they can become trainers.
Prevention and disease awareness is essential to combat the disease. This innovative program, by training health professional to managing malaria and communication techniques, contributes to raise awareness and involvement among the health care professionals.
Lessons learned
Improving public health is a complex challenge and the combination of expertise from various partners is essential to build sustainable solutions for patients most in-need.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
At the end of December 2013, more than 300 health professionals had been trained thanks to this program in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Malawi, Burundi, Benin, etc. As an example of the “Train the Trainers” approach, in 2010, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 34 initial trainers were able to train over 5,000 health community workers who learned about malaria.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) disproportionately impact over 1 billion people—mostly the world’s poor. Many NTDs can be disabling, disfiguring, stigmatizing, and in some cases, lethal.  One such NTD is Buruli Ulcer. Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic necrotizing disease of the skin and soft tissue which can cause major disabilities and in some cases death.  Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s most affected country by BU, has more 50% of all cases and ranks 172 out of 188 on the Human Development Index (HDI). 
The mode of BU transmission to humans remains unknown which makes preventing and controlling the disease an especially difficult challenge.  Consequently, the importance of early case detection and treatment to reduce morbidity and associated disabilities is vital. Additionally, limited awareness of the disease, both within the medical community and among the general public, has resulted in under-recognition, under diagnosis and under-reporting. 
MAP International’s (MAP) programmatic approach tackles removing impediments to early case detection, diagnosis and treatment.  MAP has been operating under a long-standing memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Cote d’Ivoire Ministry of Health to support neglected tropical disease and integrated health work throughout the country to strengthen the capacities of health facilities and health personnel for enhanced disease surveillance to combat BU.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2010, the AbbVie Foundation (formerly as the Abbott Fund) has supported MAP International’s work to combat NTDs in Côte d’Ivoire.  The partnership focuses on improving health outcomes by:
1) training community and health workers to improve health service delivery;
2) building community disease awareness to improve early detection;
3) accelerating diagnosis and treatment capacity for improved patient outcomes;

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In China, the medical services available to children and mothers can vary greatly by region, and this situation has resulted in child mortality rates that are anywhere from two to five times higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Moreover, roughly 40% of children under the age of five in rural areas display stunted growth.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In July 2015, Daiichi Sankyo embarked on a project targeting approximately 60,000 households in six townships in Guangnan County, in the Yunnan province of China.  This area has a particularly high number of children suffering from developmental disorders.
Daiichi Sankyo is focusing on improving the health and nutrition among children aged five and under in this impoverished area through the improvement of the healthcare system.
To accomplish this goal, we are working to develop medical professionals in community healthcare through a series of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy training (IMCI Training) sessions and by offering education to improve the capability of local pediatric care through the establishment of a community center.
The ultimate goal for this five year project is for better health for these children as well as their mothers, contributing to Access Accelerated’s mission of sustainably improving health.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Over the last 12 months, 197 pediatricians, Maternal and Child Health (MCH) doctors and village health workers have been trained on “Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)"" and their ability on treating common child illness and providing relevant guidance has been strengthened. More than 2800 children patients from rural and ethnic villages have been treated through the methodology of IMCI.
In Guangnan, 6 Community Child Development Networks (CCDN)  have been a platform to provide integrated early childhood development services for children in rural communities and managed by local volunteers that are adequately trained.
Note on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI): refers to a Comprehensive approach developed by UNICEF and WHO for early detection and treatment of childhood illnesses. It emphasizes on prevention over illness and education of caregivers which is a key component, especially on the importance of micronutrients, breastfeeding, and immunizations.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Lack of awareness about hepatitis hinders disease prevention and management in developing countries in Asia, particularly China and India. China and India together have an estimated 123 million people chronically infected with hepatitis B (HBV) and 60 million people chronically infected with hepatitis C (HCV), accounting for almost 50% of all HBV and HCV infections worldwide.
In China, about 40 million people are infected with HCV. Surging HCV incidence rates led the Chinese government to declare HCV an urgent public health issue. Prevalence of HCV is estimated to continue to grow, and associated co-morbidities such as liver disease, cirrhosis and cancer are a growing health concern.
Chronic hepatitis, when left untreated, can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Delivering Hope™: Awareness, Prevention and Care is a comprehensive effort to fight HBV and HCV in Asia, sponsored by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation. Delivering Hope draws upon the proven models created by the Foundation's work on HIV/AIDS in Africa to address a major health care challenge in resource-constrained settings.
The Foundation and its partners in China and India are working to increase hepatitis awareness among the general population and lay health care workers, especially in remote, rural areas. Efforts include disease education, vaccination and programs to help prevent mother-to-child transmissions, which are the most common means of transmission of hepatitis. Delivering Hope focuses on children as a way of building family and community awareness. In addition, in 2014 Delivering Hope established three Centers of Excellence, one in China and two in India, which focus on awareness, prevention and treatment of hepatitis. 
Delivering Hope™ has four objectives: (1) increasing public awareness of hepatitis and reducing the stigma associated with the disease; (2) promoting disease prevention, especially among groups most at risk; (3) supporting disease education and disease management training for health care workers; and (4) funding operational research to develop data and demonstration projects that generate best practices to be shared, adapted and applied in the future.
These efforts are helping to develop a portfolio of projects that aims to raise the profile of the disease in Asia, inform health policy and national programs, build institutional and community capacity, and target prevention in the hardest-hit populations including children, blood donors and health care professionals.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 2002, the Foundation has awarded grants to 19 organizations totalling USD 14 million to organizations working to reduce hepatitis-related health disparities in Asia. To date, Delivering Hope has supported 50 program grants across Asia, specifically 20 grants in mainland China, three in Taiwan, 22 in India and five in Japan, benefiting over 700,00 people directly.
More than 26 million individuals living in areas disproportionately impacted by hepatitis across Asia have benefitted from the BMSF’s Delivering Hope-related education and awareness programmes, including:

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In India, there was little common understanding of dementia among the general population in 2005 when Eisai began its educational and awareness programs. Eisai has been working to raise awareness of dementia since then through support of memory clinics across India and development and distribution of educational materials. But more needs to be done to improve access to medicines for Indian dementia patients, including the provision of Eisai’s medicinal products at affordable prices.
Access is often impeded by poverty and insufficiencies in healthcare infrastructure. Despite the advancements in effective medical therapies, many people around the world continue to lack the ability to access essential healthcare and medicines. Improving access to medicines in such countries and regions are a global challenge that needs to be tackled by national governments, international organizations and pharmaceutical companies alike.
Description of partnership activities and how they address  needs and challenges
Through a public-private partnership (PPP), HelpAge India and Eisai aim at improving awareness and treatment of dementia in India. Eisai medications are also available at discounted prices. PPPs can make a contribution towards improving the quality of healthcare in emerging countries and regions by combining the resources of the multiple organizations in innovative ways.

The prevention of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, is a priority in endemic countries in which 2.5 billion people are globally at risk of infection by dengue virus. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GSK Biologicals and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FioCruz) initiated their first collaboration with an agreement to supply oral polio vaccines in 1985.  Since then, GSK Biologicals and Fiocruz have formed several strategic alliances to provide Brazilians with key vaccines, including vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and rotavirus. This is the partners’ first collaboration on an R&D center that will focus on the development of new vaccines.
The extended vaccine partnership between GSK and FioCruz aims to create a joint R&D initiative to develop a vaccine for dengue fever. Scientists from GlaxoSmithKline in Belgium, where GSK’s vaccines division is headquartered, and FioCruz in Brazil, will be involved in the new partnership which should help to enhance Brazilian vaccine R&D capacity. Scientists from GSK and Fiocruz are working together in both Brazil and Belgium to develop a candidate vaccine against dengue fever.
The partnership establishes a research and development program that will be conducted jointly by GSK and Fiocruz to develop a vaccine for the prevention of dengue fever; the sharing of specific knowledge and development expertise between the partners is thought to be key to accelerate the development of the vaccine candidate towards its registration in Brazil at first. 
The challenges of the dengue vaccine approach (use of four serotypes and potential interferences, role of the neutralizing antibodies to avoid promoting more severe form of the disease) are addressed by the common development program which is reviewed and updated regularly by the joint management committee which is governing the collaboration between the GSK and Fiocruz partners. 
Attached to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, Fiocruz is the most prominent science and technology health institution in Latin America given the mission of fighting the great problems of public health in Brazil. Alongside research development the institution works in production of vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits, education and training of human resources, quality control of products and services and the implementation of social programs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Like many countries, China is facing a sharp increase in cancer rates. Cancer is now the number one killer in urban areas and the second leading cause of death in the country as a whole. An ageing population, pollution, heavy smoking and the adoption of a Western lifestyle mean that cancer will remain a major health issue in China for the foreseeable future.
As there is limited public reimbursement or private health insurance in China, most cancer patients have to pay themselves for their treatment. A full course of some cancer medicines can cost 10 times the average Chinese worker's annual income. Only 6% of the Chinese population has a health insurance policy that covers the costs of cancer treatment. Until recently, insurance policy pay-outs did not fund adequate medical care for cancer, and local insurance companies lacked the information to develop such policies.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2007 Roche has worked with local insurance companies in China to develop and improve health insurance coverage for cancer. Through its worldwide contacts with hospitals, laboratories and healthcare networks, Roche provides local and global data on cancer treatment options and cost analysis to the insurance companies. This enables insurance companies to determine an appropriate pay-out for treatment and to launch affordable cancer insurance policies that cover the best available treatment, access to hospitals and doctors, and cancer education and support.
In addition, in association with the insurance companies and a number of third parties, Roche provides services such as cancer awareness and prevention programmes, treatment and care follow-up and support. Such seminars, client forums and cancer awareness campaigns are helping to educate insurers and the wider population about how cancer can be treated.
Working with multi-national companies to help them provide medical coverage for their employees is another activity undertaken with this partnership.
Future developments include the “Green Channel Access plan” which helps insured to get seen quicker by the relevant doctors. Roche is bringing insurers and hospitals together to develop this plan.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Around 40 million oncology insurance policies have been sold in China thanks to collaborations between Roche and four re-insurers and 16 local insurance companies, including the three largest ones in the country. This model and associated learnings is being adapted and rolled out in over 20 Countries around the world.

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. It is estimated that in 2012, malaria caused over 627,000 deaths, mostly among African children. Cerebral malaria occurs in approximately 10% of malaria cases and is associated with a 25-50% mortality within 24-48 hours.
Chloroquine, an agent used in the treatment of malaria for several decades has become less effective, and in some areas chloroquine resistant parasites have climbed to 90% of cases. Resistance to the newer agent artemisinin has also been described. Given the widespread prevalence of malaria and the resistance observed with available drugs, the availability of newer agents for its treatment is extremely urgent.

The African region has the fastest growth of diabetes, which will double in the next 20 years, the highest rate of undiagnosed diabetes and the highest mortality rate due to diabetes. The main problems are the late diagnosis, the severe complications due to diabetes, the high mortality rate and the poor quality of life of people with diabetes. The diabetic foot is a complication of diabetes that carries a high morbidity and mortality rate in Africa, and is increasing as the burden of diabetes continues to rise. Amputations remain high, despite intensive training of health workers in traditional preventive methods. Diabetes care in Africa has only recently assumed a quality priority. 

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Diabetes Africa Foot Initiative (DAFI) aims to address the lack of a common, regionally accepted, sustainable and comprehensive approach for diabetic foot care in the region. DAFI is a two-phase initiative that will be implemented in ten countries: Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda.
The first phase (2012-2014) aimed to develop and implement a Risk Stratification and Intervention Tool and its associated protocol in ten diabetes centres in the selected countries. Health workers from these institutions were trained on diabetes foot care through e-diabetes in collaboration with UNFM and a few of them followed a more specialized training developed by the University of Johannesburg and University Senghor to be certified as Diabetes Foot Care Assistants. In collaboration with health authorities and local communities, IDF member associations started information activities for people with diabetes.
During the first phase:
10 centers were selected and 30 health workers (each center identified one doctor and two nurses) were trained and certified.
Risk stratification and intervention tools and related protocol were developed and are ongoing ethical committees’ clearance.
A distance learning program about foot care was established.
In the second phase of the initiative (2015-2017), the ten participating centres are expected to become accredited reference centres to train peripheral centres about diabetes foot care and roll-out the program in the selected countries. The impact of the risk stratification and intervention tool will be measured. Community activities led by IDF member associations will be strengthened in collaboration with health authorities.
The objective is to develop a sustainable Diabetes Africa Foot Initiative that will contribute to preventing foot amputation in people with diabetes and improving diabetes care in Sub-Saharan Africa.

There are around 15,000–20,000 diabetic children in Turkey, and 1700 new children are diagnosed each year. Diabetic children suffer a variety of problems in school, such as being kept off physical education and school trips. Yet, all diabetic juveniles deserve the same educational opportunities as their peers. A lot of this responsibility falls on the teachers. Educating teachers about diabetes is an essential step that will reduce the problems faced by diabetic children in school and improve their quality of life. In addition, teachers might help ensure an early diagnosis before the disease advances.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In Turkey, as part of the National Diabetes Program, and in partnership with the Turkish Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and the Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Association, Sanofi is organizing an ambitious project - Diabetes at School - to help manage type 1 diabetes at school and raise awareness among children and teachers of childhood obesity and healthy eating habits in Turkish schools. 
Between 2010-2016 the main milestones included:
Awareness raising in schools by displaying posters in 60,000 schools nationwide. In addition,  Pediatric endocrinology units sent  letters explaining diabetes care to teachers.
A one-day training conference attended by 300 people took place in Ankara. This conference allowed preparing school seminars such as the Nationwide Educations in Schools program and a Digital Education Platform, a website (www.okuldadiyabet.org) which was created to provide easy access to educational documents for the 60,000 schools in 81 municipalities.
“Teacher Makes Difference” award, 142 applications submitted and 8 teachers were awarded
The Ministry of Education revised the circular on Diabetic Children in 2013,  to extend its scope to school administrators, teachers, parents and school bus drivers and circulated to 60.000 schools
In 2014, a public spot allowed to create awareness in the general public on Type I diabetes and diabetes at school
The program was included in the National Diabetes Control Program
Recognition of Diabetic Schools by an acknowledgment certificate to the teachers and to schools who are influencer in diagnosing diabetic children 
The program has had a great contribution in terms of raising awareness and enhancing type 1 diabetes early diagnosis in school age children, reinforced by a permanent educational resource on diabetes and obesity created for teachers and students. Collaboration has also been reinforced, with a strong basis of cooperation and interaction being developed between the Ministry of National Education, the Ministry of Health and the “Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Association”. 
The Diabetes at School in Turkey Program has been a great success and its scope has continuously increased both geographically and in terms of targets and it is one of the good example of collaboration between various actors. The Ministry of National Education, teachers and school officials, public have been made aware of the problems diabetic children face every day.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Children and adolescents suffering from mental disabilities need a high quality care, including early diagnosis, the development of suitable centers, multidisciplinary treatment, and support for re-integration. However, in countries where difficulties due to social inequalities often weigh on the mentally disabled, access to such treatment can be random. And associations in these countries fighting to promote the rights of the disabled people still have to struggle to make their voices heard.
In Algeria, the partial epidemiologic data show that 10,000 births a year involve some form of mental disability. Despite the determination of public authorities, there are still considerable areas for improvement: the lack of early screening for post-natal mental conditions; the lack of diagnosis and guidance concerning multidisciplinary treatment (medical, psychological and social); an insufficient number of public and private specialized centers; the failure to integrate disabled children into normal school classrooms; the lack of real opportunities for social and economic reinsertion; the lack of guidance for parents, who struggle to have their disabled children accepted by society.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This action aims to strengthen three (civic society) organizations in Algeria, Tunisia and Lebanon that represent people living with mental disabilities, with a view to transferring skills.
In Algeria, by raising awareness among early childhood workers and parents about the early detection of disorders right from birth, especially in the BEO District.
In Lebanon, by developing the early diagnosis and referral for the appropriate care of children suffering from intellectual disabilities.
In Tunisia, by focusing on the socio-economic integration of people with intellectual disabilities.
The program involves supporting medical-social actions in the field through the development of vocational training, giving guidance to families, and sharing experiences and practices among associations.
Lessons learned
Working with local health authorities and local organizations (NGO, unions) makes the program stronger and long-lasting. Futhermore, the Government must integrate in their national health action plan, early diagnosis, care and integration of children/people with mental disabilities.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
40,000 babies were examined in Algeria in 2011 and 1400 families received support in the treatment and integration of their child.
In 2012, a Trans-Mediterranean meeting was held in Marseille, France, to take stock of the progress achieved and to share experiences among Mediterranean associations in the areas of early detection, care and socio-economic integration of people with intellectual disabilities, in order to build on best practices.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Increased access to HIV and AIDS treatment has improved prognosis of HIV-infected patient. However many patients continue to die of HIV-related opportunistic infections. In Sub-Saharan alone, more than 500,000 deaths are attributed to crypotococcal meningitis.
Prevention and treatment of HIV-related opportunistic infection is an important part of care for people with HIV and AIDS, since these conditions continue to cause high morbidity in infected patients throughout the world. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
As part of the commitment to increasing the availability of medicines for those most in need, Pfizer created the Diflucan® Partnership Program (DPP) on the 1st of December 2000. Through this program, Diflucan® (fluconazole), an antifungal medicine is provided free of charge to governmental and nongovernmental organizations in developing countries with greater than 1% HIV and AIDS prevalence, for the treatment of two fungal opportunistic infections associated with HIV and AIDS.
The administrative partner, Direct Relief, has been commisssioned to provide technical assistance, supports program management and manage the distribution of Diflucan to participating governments and organizations. Pfizer also develops and distributes materials to support patient education and health care professional training.
Lessons learned
Private–public partnerships are instrumental in achieving the program’s objectives of ensuring an uninterrupted access to a much needed anti-fungal medicine. Close collaboration between Pfizer and Direct Relief is helping align Diflucan® demand & supply processes i.e. ensuring adequate Inventory levels, increased stock turnover and reduced POS obsolescence at the warehouse. 
Inventory Management and Control— Limited capacity to account for existing stock at site level & poor reporting from health facilities can lead to over/under-supply of sites and possible unreported expiry of product.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Globally the program has donated more than $1.6 billion USD in medicine to more than 6,081 sites in 63 countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America.
Improved operational efficiencies and developed Interactive Map to ensure access to comprehensive distribution data for the program.
There continues to be a significant shift in the HIV and AIDS environment since 2000 when the epidemic was widespread; and HIV medicines were unavailable and unaffordable. Today new studies indicate that the Cryptococcal antigen is detectable in the blood several weeks to months before symptomatic disease occurs, and that early treatment with Fluconazole can prevent progression to meningitis and the associated high mortality rates. Pfizer is, therefore, looking at the developments more broadly to explore feasible options and collaborative efforts to ensure a sustainable solution.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Unacceptable standards of care for pregnant & birthing women, especially indigenous prevail in Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Panama and other Central American countries, as seen by maternal mortality ratios.
For example, in Chiapas, Mexico maternal mortality ratio ranges from 80 to 90 per 100,000 and in pockets of Guerrero the mortality maternal range is over 200 with only 1 gynecologist to 17,654 women in mountainous area. Indigenous women of low education levels all over Latin America die 3 times more often than non-indigenous women of causes related to pregnancy and birth.
In Panama maternal mortality ratio for indigenous women is 300 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and MMRs are similar amongst the indigenous in Guatemala and in Ecuador.
A very low percentage of indigenous women in Guatemala and Ecuador – 17 to 20% - have skilled care, (SBAs) during their pregnancies and births.
According to Mexico’s National Center for Gender Equity and Reproductive Health, 30,000 women a year of all backgrounds experience secondary negative consequences often over a lifetime due to mismanagement of pregnancy and birth. Some 30,000 Mexican children die annually before reaching their first birthday.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The nonprofit CASA NGO opened Mexico’s first government accredited, private, nonprofit midwifery school in 1994 and helped the government of Guerrero open the country’s second  first public midwifery school in 2012.
The partnership with the Sanofi Espoir Foundation helps to train more indigenous midwives. It will also help to scale up the two midwifery schools’ curriculum by including digital skills for increasing the number of clinically and digitally competent, quality indigenous midwives graduating from the current government accredited midwifery schools in Mexico.
An elite team of 12 midwife mentors will also be formed.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
By the end of the project 225 students from Mexico, Panama, Ecuador and Guatemala will be enrolled and there will be 139 graduates. These 139 midwives will be able to serve 69,500 women a year.
CASA will also going on working closely with the health authorities to make sure that these indigenous midwifes could be hired to work, in particular in maternity centers and hospital in rural areas.
CASA will also advocate and help the health authorities for opening a third public school by the end of 2014.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
AbbVie collaborates with partners to build health system capacity and infrastructure to increase access to care globally. Reducing neonatal mortality is a UN priority and is included as a Sutainable Development Goal, aiming to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five by 2030. The governments of India, Jamaica, Paraguy and Honduras all have high-level commitments to address this issue. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2015 AbbVie joined forces with Direct Relief to respond to the health objectives of India, Jamaica, Paraguy and Honduras. AbbVie donated 1000 bottles of medicine to hospitals in the above mentioned countries in order to help reduce neonatal mortality. As a result of this donation program, more than 1000 infants will receive treatment. 
In Cambodia, infant and under-five mortality rates are among the highest in Southeast Asia and is an issue that also needs to be tackled. AbbVie has donated medicines since 2006 to treat epilepsy and seizure disorders, thyroid issues and lower respiratory infections. In 2015, 16,000 doses of medicine were donated to treat epilepsy and seizure disorders. In addition to this, 5,300 bottles of antibiotics were donated for the treatment of lower respiratory infections.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Transmitted by the bite of the kissing bug or vinchuca, Chagas disease is a public health problem particularly in poor areas of Latin America and the Caribbean. About eight million people are believed to carry it and about a third of these will develop serious heart or intestinal damage that can lead to death if left untreated. Health problems arising from the chronic stage of Chagas have a large impact on society and the economy.
Only two drugs, discovered decades ago with limited efficacy at the chronic phase of the disease and with poor tolerability profile in adults, are currently available. The development of a new treatment which could be effective for the chronic phase of the disease, particularly in adults, would therefore represent an important advance.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In September 2009, Eisai and DNDi, an independent, not-for-profit product development partnership based in Geneva, Switzerland, signed a collaboration and license agreement for the clinical development of fosravuconazole, the prodrug of ravuconazole, for the treatment of Chagas disease. Ravuconazole, an anti-fungal drug discovered and developed by Eisai, has been shown in vitro and in vivo to have activity against the pathogen responsible for Chagas disease.
Under the terms of the agreement, Eisai provides fosravuconazole as well as its scientific expertise to DNDi for their clinical development to assess the safety and efficacy of this drug. 
Phase I studies have already been completed in the USA, demonstrating a well-tolerated safety profile and long half-life. Phase II study results were disclosed in 2013 by DNDi.
Eisai is supporting DNDi by supplying E1224 and regularly participates in project team meetings with DNDi.
While DNDi fully utilizes its knowledge, experience and expertise in NTD areas and developing countries, Eisai provides DNDi with its scientific expertise in clinical development as well as supplying the drug for the clinical studies. Eisai has the option to become the industrial partner with DNDi to manufacture, register and make available E1224 at an affordable price to the public sector in endemic countries.
Lessons learned
Through the new drug development partnership with DNDi, Eisai has been learning about the various challenges for smooth conduct of clinical studies in developing countries. Eisai has been sharing with DNDi the knowledge it has about the compound, as its originator company.
Summary of impact and any forward looking information
According to the first phase 2 study result, fosravuconazole showed good safety and was effective at clearing the parasite that causes Chagas disease, but didn’t present sustained efficacy for one year as a single medication. However, since current treatment has undesirable side effects, DNDi and Eisai are conducting another phase 2 study (combination of benznidazole and fosravuconazole) in Bolivia and Argentina based on safety confirmed in a drug-drug interaction study.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Kampong Speu is the poorest province in Cambodia where there is only very limited access to medical care, especially obstetric and neonatal care. The referral hospital to accommodate pregnancies with complications is more than 100 km from the remotest village. Health services lack staff and equipment. Midwifery skills are not up to the needs and their availability and their relationships with patients from the villages cannot ensure high quality monitoring of pregnancies.
Due to this lack of access, facilities and knowledge, village women still do not use health services very frequently. Less than half of all deliveries are carried out by competent persons. There is also a very low level of education in the villages and many beliefs and practices that are harmful to mothers and their babies still persist.
In 2010, the maternal mortality rate in the province of Kampong Speu was 206 per 100,000 births and the neonatal mortality rate was 31 per 1,000 live births, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas.
To achieve the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, the Ministry of Health has implemented a plan to improve emergency obstetric and neonatal care, based on improving and extending the skills in certain health centers so that they become referral facilities for emergency care. However, a large number of training courses will still be required to reach this level of care.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This project aims to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality by stepping up care services, especially in obstetric and neonatal emergencies, and provide better resources for communities. It is based on two complementary actions: training midwives to improve the quality of services in hospitals and health centers and training village doulas to inform and support women during pregnancy and the first months of their babies’ lives.
The project will build a sustainable network of collaboration between midwives and doulas. It will also work with the government to ensure recognition for doula training.
The doula system was launched in Cambodia in 2010 by Enfants & Développement. Doulas provide women with information and support for their sexual and reproductive health, while educating them about their rights. They accompany them during their pregnancy and the first months of their child’s life. Without providing strictly medical care, they act as the interface between pregnant women and the public health services - particularly midwives.

Teenage pregnancy prevention is one of the key social challenges in the fight against poverty. The number of pregnant Brazilian teenagers is now 2% greater than in last decade. According to data from the Datasus – Ministry of Health – 28% of live births in Brazil during 2004 were to mothers aged 10 to 19. According to the same source, 104,716 teenagers became mothers in 2004 in São Paulo. The study Juventudes Brasileiras, conducted by the UNESCO, determined that 25% of girls who become pregnant as teens eventually quit school.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Resulting from a partnership between Pfizer and Instituto Kaplan, education and social services association, Dreaming is Worthwile is a project focused to prevent pregnancy in adolescents. It recognizes that while teenage pregnancy is caused by many factors, inadequate sex education in Brazil is one of the most significant. The project joins knowledge about sexuality, reproduction and contraception to each adolescent’s desired career to leverage motivation to safe sex, and has the purpose of developing a sense of personal responsibility in adolescents by explaining the social and individual changes to a teenager’s life caused by pregnancy and showing them how a pregnancy could impact their life projects.
Awareness about pregnancy risk and provides information on reproductive choices (birth control methods). It also helps young people understand their vulnerability and develop lower risk behavior. Dreaming is Worthwhile explains the social and individual changes to a teenager’s life caused by pregnancy.
Lessons learned                             
Pfizer actively contributes in order to make each country and community in which it operates a better place to live and work. In Brazil, Pfizer has elected health education as the focus of its action in social projects, recognizing its talent and making available its experience and ability for enhancing people’s quality of life.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Despite considerable progress in the overall global HIV/AIDS response, gender and age disparities in high-HIV burden remain almost unchanged. 380,000 girls and young women are infected with HIV every year in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 71 percent of new HIV infections among adolescents in the region. In 2014, this figure represented nearly half of all the new HIV infections that occurred among adolescent girls and young women globally.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
DREAMS delivers a core package that combines evidence-based approaches that go beyond the health sector, addressing the structural drivers that directly and indirectly increase girls’ HIV risk, including poverty, gender inequality, sexual violence, and a lack of education.
Many adolescent girls and young women lack a full range of opportunities and are too often devalued because of gender bias, leading them to be seen as unworthy of investment or protection. Social isolation, economic disadvantage, discriminatory cultural norms, orphanhood, gender-based violence, and school drop-out all contribute to girls’ vulnerability to HIV.
Measurement of progress towards objectives:
Launched on World AIDS Day 2014, DREAMS is delivering a Core Package of evidence-informed interventions in 10 countries - Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe - which account for nearly half of all new HIV infections. DREAMS Partners include the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Girl Effect, Johnson & Johnson, Gilead Sciences, and ViiV Healthcare.
In February 2016, PEPFAR, Janssen, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and ViiV Healthcare launched the DREAMS Innovation Challenge. Together, they committed $85 million for this new initiative which is calling for high-impact innovative, sustainable solutions in six focus areas of work:

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The worst drought in 60 years is plaguing the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya and Ethiopia). There has been no rain for four years in some localities, leading to a severe food crisis and soaring prices for basic foodstuffs. In these countries, 13.3 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, and over 841,130 people are refugees. These populations are affected by problems of access to safe water and food in general, and malnutrition in particular.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The assistance provided by Sanofi Espoir Foundation to UNICEF in the healthcare field has been mainly focused on Somalia, the epicenter of the crisis.To help children affected by the crisis, UNICEF has sent five tons of supplies (therapeutic foods, drugs) since last June as well as equipment to improve water supplies in Baidoa (South-West of Somalia). UNICEF is working with local Health Ministries, the World Food Program, NGOs and international organizations, mainly to maintain routine immunization campaigns, stepping up access to drinking water programs, and improving sanitation facilities in the camps.
UNICEF priority healthcare actions in Somalia include:
Providing technical support (training health workers) and logistics solutions (e.g. vaccines, basic equipment, essential drugs) at more than 200 clinics for maternal and child health and 100 healthcare centers (target: reach out to 2.5 million women and children).
To extend immunization coverage against measles to 2.5 million children aged from 6 months -15 years.
Providing Vitamin A supplements for more than 1 million children aged 6 to 59 months.
Ensure each month the therapeutic management of at least 17,000 children with severe acute malnutrition by means of technical and logistical support to 200 intensive nutritional rehabilitation programs located in the south (Target: 200,000 children)
Lessons learned
Healthcare is one the most vital needs in humanitarian disasters. Organizations and their partners have to act quickly, but only after having evaluate the population’s needs, and coordinating with the other NGO/health authorities acting on the field. Emergency activities have to be followed by more long term actions. In all the cases we have been through, the crisis still continues for months, even for years.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
At the end of 2011, 3,500 medical kits were distributed to 150 health centers for mothers and children as well as 300 healthcare and prevention programs in schools. 670,000 children (6 months-15 years) have received Vitamin A tablets. 700,000 children (6 months-15 years) were vaccinated against measles.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), NTDs blight the lives of more than 1 billion of the world's poorest 2.4 billion people. There are 149 countries and territories where NTDs are endemic, at least 100 of which are endemic for 2 or more of these diseases, and 30 countries and territories of which are endemic for 6 or more. These diseases not only survive and spread in conditions of poverty but also anchor large populations in poverty.
Chagas disease is transmitted by the bite of the assassin bug or vinchuca and is particularly endemic in poorer areas of Latin America and the Caribbean. Approximately 8 million people are believed to carry the disease and 100 million people are estimated to be living in endemic areas. In Latin America alone, about 14,000 people die from Chagas disease on average each year, meaning that the development of a novel treatment for this disease exists as a high unmet medical need.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Eisai has announced a global agreement with the Broad Institute, a collaborative research facility that includes researchers from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to jointly discover and develop new therapeutic agents for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and tuberculosis.
Under the agreement, Eisai and Broad will collaborate together on drug discovery initiatives toward novel treatments for NTDs and tuberculosis through optimization of compounds screened from Broad's chemical library. The first project will conduct drug discovery research aimed at the creation of a novel treatment for Chagas disease.
This first project for the treatment of Chagas disease has also been awarded a grant for partial funding by the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund), an international nonprofit organization aimed to advance the research and development of new health technologies from Japan to fight infectious diseases prevalent specifically in the developing world, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the International Diabetes Federation, Africa region, that includes 49 diverse sub Saharan countries and territories, an estimated 14.2 million adults have diabetes, representing a regional prevalence ranging from 2.1 to 6.7%.  . The Africa Region has the highest proportion of undiagnosed diabetes, i.e. over two thirds (66.7%) of people with diabetes are unaware they have the disease. The management of diabetes in Africa is an issue which is increased by the lack of health professionals (particularly in French-speaking Africa) and the focus on infectious diseases.
It is thus urgent for professionals to know how to diagnose and treat the condition, wherever they operate in the healthcare organization. This education can prevent amputation and cardiovascular pathologies in people with diabetes.
We live in a world where the need, and the demand, for lifelong learning and continuous professional development are ever increasing. With the training and learning needs of healthcare professionals threatening to outstrip budgets and time resources particularly in the out of reach areas where access to continuously evolving advances in medicine is limited, e-learning can offer sensible, workable cost and time saving solutions to a range of key needs for learners.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
An innovative approach to improve diabetes care in Africa, e-diabete is an educational program, developed by the Université Numérique Francophone Mondiale (World French-speaking Digital University) (UNFM), with the support of Senghor university and in collaboration with the RAFT Network and Sanofi.
Using low-speed internet, more than 1,500 healthcare professionals are connecting to monthly teleconferences to improve their knowledge about diabetes and be more prepared to treat people with diabetes. 
Since 2009, the UNFM has worked in close partnership with the RAFT Network, Sanofi, and Senghor University (Egypt), to support the development of this unique interactive program.
The second Thursday of each month, HCPs attend educational teleconferences to interact directly and exchange experiences with teachers, who are local and international diabetes experts.
Participation in the teleconferences is increasingly extending to include not only diabetologists but also internists, nurses, cardiologists, surgeons and others HCPs, so that all healthcare professionals are aligned when administering the primary care to the diabetic patients, in order to improve early diagnosis of diabetes and reduce risks of associated complications (e.g. amputations) and premature death. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The true success of e-diabete program in Africa is both technological and human:
•  The conferences use low-speed internet technology, allowing medical centers from countries with limited equipment to connect easily.
•   The transfer of competences has today permitted 60% of the courses to be carried out live from African countries.
Each month, at least 50 different hospitals are connected. More than 1,500 healthcare professionals in 23 English and French speaking countries in Africa now attend monthly educational teleconferences to interact directly and exchange experiences. The program now includes modules on pediatric management.
The transfer of competences has today permitted the local appropriation with 80% (10 out of 12 in French Speaking countries) of the sessions to be carried out live from the African countries. The other speakers are based in Geneva, London or Paris.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Every year, 7 million children per year die before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable and treatable diseases such as respiratory infections, (diarrhea, measles, malaria and malnutrition.
Maternal and newborn mortality is also a significant challenge. Every day women and newborn babies die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth. While under five mortality has been decreased over the past years, there has been little progress in reducing neonatal mortality.
To tackle these challenges, training in maternal and newborn and child care must be scaled up globally.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, is one of the cornerstones of the drive to reach the child health-related Millennium Development Goals. To improve maternal and newborn care, WHO promotes a package of interventions and guidelines of the Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC).
In order to scale up the IMCI workforce the Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development supported the WHO in the development of an innovative e-learning tool. ICATT (IMCI Computerized Adaptation and Training Tool) enables a large number of health workers to be trained in IMCI in a cost-effective way without a loss in quality.
The Novartis Foundation also supports the WHO and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute to develop an e-learning tool for training in IMPAC. Called IMPACtt, the tool is based on the ICATT software and will comprise training modules in pregnancy care, childbirth, newborn care, and postnatal care. The first module on Essential Newborn Care has been tested successfully in Tanzania and in the Philippines.                  
The Novartis Foundation is currently working with the University of Geneva to conduct a study in West Africa comparing the training outcomes and costs of ICATT compared with traditional IMCI learning.
The foundation also works with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute on a survey to provide an overview of countries currently using ICATT, lessons learned and recommendations for rolling out other global e-learning tools such as IMPACtt.
Results have shown that that ICATT can reduce training time and costs and allows for faster and more flexible scale up of IMCI training. 
WHO estimates that to date around 24 countries have completed IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) adaptation through ICATT.

In Uganda, 58% of women deliver their infants without the help of a midwife. According to the latest statistics from the Uganda Council of Nurses and Midwives, 11,100 midwives need training to be registered as professionals and provide quality care to the people.
Using existing traditional courses would be impossible to rapidly increase the number of midwives and ensure quality care for mothers in Uganda. New communication technologies, however, have the double advantage of rapidly increasing the number of training courses available and enabling health workers to improve their training whenever they wish at home or in the office.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
AMREF has set up an e-Learning training program to allow 11,100 midwives to obtain a professional qualification.
This program is part of the “Stand up for African Mothers” initiative, launched in 2011 by AMREF, with the support of the Foundation.
This international mobilization has for objectives to train 15,000 midwives in Africa by 2015 and to support the 2015 Noble Prize candidacy of Esther Madudu, a midwife from Uganda, as a symbol for all African midwives.
The project focuses on three areas:
Designing, testing and implementing a remedial eLearning courses for midwives in Uganda.
Developing skills and sharing of expertise between the AMREF office in Uganda, human resources departments in the Ministries of Education and Health and the Uganda Council of Nurses and Midwives be enabling them to design, implement and monitor training via eLearning.
Using the results from Kenya to influence health policy and replicate the program in Uganda and other regions by applying a reusable template for remedial health staff training in an environment with limited resources.

Insufficient access to quality primary healthcare is a major obstacle to improving patient health outcomes. Collaborating with the Ifakara Health Institute and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, the Novartis Foundation addressed this complex challenge in Tanzania with supportive supervision, using the electronic Tool to Improve Quality in Health (e-TIQH). The tool allows health system managers to provide more efficient supervision of the facilities under their umbrella, and allows them to provide real-time performance feedback to the health workers in these facilities.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Supportive supervision has proven to be the most important contributing factor for improving quality of care, and the digital tool allows health managers to assess performance more accurately. With improved analysis, report generation and information sharing, e-TIQH delivers real-time evidence for health system planning and budget allocation.
e-TIQH was piloted in two districts around Ifakara before being expanded to the entire Morogoro region and an additional eight regions in Tanzania. Further roll out of e-TIQH will now be handed over to the Prime Minister’s Office of Regional Administration and Local Government in Tanzania.
In addition, this digital, supportive supervision tool is currently being adapted and validated for use within all public health services in Mali. In the coming year, we will also finalize a toolkit outlining how to use this digital supervision approach as a means to strengthen quality of care in primary healthcare systems, to make it more widely available.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Improving knowledge of health, particularily around cancer, and building healthcare capacity is a priority for the Ministry of Health of Turkey. To create new models in cancer control and reduce cancer mortality rates, the ministry has built Cancer Early Diagnosis Screening and Training Centres (KETEMs) throughout the country.
The KETEMs are equipped with the latest diagnostic equipment and conduct screening programs for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers. The centres also serve to drive awareness of the importance of prevention and early diagnosis in cancer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2009 Roche supported construction of a KETEM in the capital city of Turkey, Ankara. Today it is one of around 200 KETEMs located throughout the country.
Awareness of the importance of prevention and early diagnosis in increasing the chances of survival is paramount in fighting cancer. So Roche partnered with the Ministry of Health to organise training sessions for healthcare professionals and the public and to improve early stage diagnosis in line with established screening standards.
As part of the drive to raise awareness and encourage people to visit KETEMs, Roche supported the nationwide Blue Bicycle: Hit the Road for Cancer Early Diagnosis campaign in partnership with the Turkish Bicycle Federation and Ministry of Health. Participants in the bike ride, which was held each year from 2006 to 2011, completed six laps of a course that passed through 26 cities, and involved over >10,000 people. Roche made a donation on behalf of each participant to KETEMs in all cities visited by the riders.
During the event, local medical doctors in each city conducted cancer seminars for the public.
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
Currently, close to 200 KETEMs are operational, and at least one in each province is integrated into a government hospital. 23 of the KETEMs are mobile. Each KETEM is designed to render services for populations of 250,000.
In 2016, it is planned to open 40 more KETEMs where patients can be screened for several cancer types.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The global health community is deeply concerned by the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa and its consequences on the health systems and the population of the countries most affected – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests, but the 2014 outbreak in west Africa has involved major urban as well as rural areas.
Historically, the number of people affected annually and the overall disease burden of Ebola is – in comparison to other diseases such as malaria or HIV – small and outbreaks tend to be sporadic and quickly controlled. Perhaps for this reason, compared to the focus given to the WHO’s 17 neglected tropical diseases, and malaria, HIV and TB which also affect poor countries, Ebola has not been prioritised by the international community as an area for research and vaccine development until now. Therefore no licensed anti-viral treatment or vaccine are currently available so far against this terrible disease.
Following the significant outbreak of Ebola in west Africa  in 2014, the WHO has developed a comprehensive road map including measures against disease spread, disease diagnosis and care, new health centres, social mobilisation, and safe burials, as well as fast-tracking access to experimental treatments and vaccines.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
With the Ebola crisis in West Africa continuing, GSK is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO), regulators and other partners to respond to the outbreak, to accelerate development of its investigational Ebola vaccine and to ramp up production as quickly as possible.
Through the acquisition of a Swiss/Italian biotechnology company, Okairos, in May 2013, GSK acquired a pre-clinical vaccine candidate for Ebola, (including the Zaire strain responsible for the current outbreak) which had been co-developed by Okairos and the US National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC). In 2015, the first batch of GSK’s vaccine was shipped to west Africa, containing 300 vials of the candidate vaccine.  Currently, the vaccine is still in a trial phase and the extent of its effectiveness is yet to be seen. One of the challenges faced is how to scale up the production of the vaccines without slowing down the production of other life-saving vaccines that are important for public health. 
As part of an international initiative, funding from partners that include Wellcome Trust, the UK Government, the Medical Research Council, GAVI and the BMGF  aims to help accelerate development of the vaccine candidate in response to the WHO declared Public Health Emergency and GSK is supporting this accelerated development process. This Ebola outbreak is an unusual and rapidly changing situation with a unique risk/benefit scenario requiring a unique response that needs to be guided by the WHO and others. 
GSK is also contributing to the overall humanitarian effort and on-going efforts to strengthen healthcare infrastructure in the most affected countries.

Researchers from LMICs who are involved in clinical research projects have limited opportunities to acquire experience and develop skills for conducting clinical trials outside of an academic or public sector setting.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Founded in 1999 to promote high quality clinical research in LMICs, the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) Career Development Fellowships (CDF) program, developed with the help of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), offers targeted training to enhance competencies in clinical trials for medicines, vaccines and diagnostics on a broad range of infectious diseases of poverty. CDF fellows from hospitals, academic and research institutions in low- and middle-income countries are selected to work in the clinical department of a host pharmaceutical company or product development partnership (PDPs) to receive training on R&D project management, Good Clinical Practice and regulatory requirements. To date, 8 IFPMA member companies have participated in the program.  
In 2012, the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) partnered with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) to offer researchers similar placements in pharmaceutical companies. EDCTP is a partnership between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa that supports the clinical development of new or improved interventions to prevent or treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected infectious diseases and related research capacity building.
In 2014, TDR and EDCTP signed an agreement to harmonize and streamline their two fellowship programs. The partnership ensures synergies for the organizations involved, and facilitates common communication with researchers and clinical staff, pharmaceutical companies, PDPs and research institutions. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Between 2008 and 2014, 32 fellows were trained as part of the TDR fellowship programme. The EDCTP-TDR collaboration will allow for this number to increase in future years. 
An external review from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) of TDR’s career development fellowship has found the program has an impact on a broad range of factors, with ample future potential for continued growth and extension. Altogether, 95% of survey respondents think that their skills and competencies in good clinical or laboratory practices were “better” or “much better” at the end of the program.
TDR and EDCTP launched their first joint call on 31 October 2014. 20 product development organizations offered to host fellows in 2015, including Astellas, Bayer, GSK, Novartis, Merck, Sanofi and Sanofi Pasteur. The host organisations trained scientists – for a period of up to 24 months – to develop specialist product development skills not readily taught in academic centres or public research institutions. On returning to their home organizations, the fellows are expected to become an important resource for institutional capacity development to undertake and manage clinical research in accordance with international regulatory requirements and standards.
CDF fellows have come from 19 African countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Botswana, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, The Gambia, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Others have come from China, Colombia, Peru and Vietnam.
A second joint call was launched on the 22 October 2015 and a third joint call was launched in October 2016, for which Merck is confirmed as host organization. 
Up until 2013, Eisai also participated in the EDCTP-TDR Clinical Research Development Fellowships. Eisai had TDR program twice: once in 2010-2011 and then 2011-2012.

Cancer is now one of the leading causes of death in low and middle income countries, with more than half of all new cancer cases – and over 60% of cancer deaths – occurring in poorer regions of the world. In sub Saharan Africa (SSA), survival rates for one third of patients could be increased if cancer is detected earlier, but the lack of trained cancer professionals, adequate cancer care services and public awareness campaigns severely limits health system response.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Roche and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), through the EDUCARE (EDUcation for Cancer in African REgions) initiative, have combined their shared knowledge and expertise in cancer control to establish a virtual university, supported by the development of a regional African training and mentorship network, collectively called VUCCnet. It consists of:
Virtual University for Cancer Control (VUCC), an accredited online virtual university to provide comprehensive cancer training across Africa.
Regional African Cancer Training Network (RACT), a training program on-site at several cancer centers in SSA reflecting a curricula appropriate for the specific needs of the region (e.g. prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, nursing, palliative care).
The training program aims to build human resource capacity through the training of healthcare professionals in Africa to combat the growing cancer epidemic. Training centers will be part of a network which ultimately can be connected to a broader group of healthcare workers across other African countries, to help them in their own cancer control initiatives.
The first phase is to establish four pilot centres which are recognized National Centres of Competence, with training in planning, administration and management of the centre. This includes:
Creating a cancer training network including specialists from the Ministries of Health. 
Aiding specialists from the Ministries of Health in securing better healthcare resources. 
Providing a mix of training curricula for healthcare professionals in multiple aspects of cancer control, such as radiotherapy, nursing, palliative care and public health through low-cost web-based learning tools. 
Augmenting cancer professionals through multi-disciplinary cancer management skills and `train the trainer programs. 
Once established, it is anticipated that each Cancer Centre of Competence will facilitate access to diagnosis and cancer care for a catchment of approximately 5 million people. In the long term it is hoped that the outcomes of the EDUCARE pilot initiative in sub-Saharan Africa will be used as a model by the IAEA to roll-out across Africa and other developing regions of the world in Asia and Latin America.
The progress to date includes the following:
The Virtual University website has been established.
The test phase of 3 courses has been completed with around 350 students, spanning all four pilot countries (Cancer skills package for Community Health Workers; Palliative Care; Cervical Cancer Prevention & Early Detection).

Colombia is improving the delivery of healthcare services, but increasing access to innovative treatments and improving support for serious chronic diseases such as cancer remain among the country’s greatest challenges.
Breast cancer, for example, is the cause of the highest number of female deaths from cancer, about 2,200 annually. According to the National Cancer Institute in Colombia, approximately 7,000 new cases of breast cancer are reported every year. However, as Colombian women are often not aware of the risk factors for cancer, or of the importance of early detection, they often present to the doctor in an advanced stage.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
As the world leader in oncology, Roche is working hand-in-hand with some of Colombia’s largest healthcare organizations on a broad range of healthcare awareness and prevention programs, such as:
Women Consulting Rooms: In 2012, Roche introduced a country-wide initiative called “Women Consulting Rooms”, or “Consultorios para la mujer”, dedicated to women. Trained healthcare professionals provide awareness of diseases and diagnostic testing enabling early detection of diseases, such as breast cancer. The first room opened in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city.
Health awareness in Jails: Roche is promoting breast cancer awareness and prevention in Colombian jails, which house approximately 6,500 women. The project started in 2013 in the Buen Pastor jail in Bogotá in collaboration with the National Prison and Penitentiary Institute (INPEC).
Patient support programs: Roche established the “Tiempo de vivir” - (Time to Live) program to provide broad support for cancer patients, their families and caregivers. The program offers education on how to manage the disease, the importance of adhering to treatment according to the instructions of the physician, as well as non-pharmacological management of adverse events. Roche also provides supporting materials with information on nutrition and healthy living habits, and conduct workshops, such as art therapy, and support groups. 
Patients have access to telephone support from a team of specialized advisors and nurses. Additionally, in major cities, nurses accompany a patient to infusion rooms during treatment. A nurse may also visit a patient in their home, providing an information kit about the program. The support team then monitors the patient’s progress and invites them to workshops and conferences to learn about managing the physical and psychological impacts of cancer.
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
By 2015, 128 Women Consulting Rooms have been established in 63 cities throughout Colombia. Over 130,000 women have visited the Consulting rooms, and as a result, nearly 800 women have been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.
In addition, Roche has expanded the Patient Support Programs to cover other diseases such as arthritis, cystic fibrosis, transplantation and patients with anemia. These programs support over 10,000 patients all over the country.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
Many people in emerging and developing countries do not have sufficient access to high quality medicinal products at affordable prices. Technology transfer and local manufacturing in developing countries helps Eisai implement its Affordable Pricing Policy, which seeks to allow the company to “supply products in a sustainable manner at prices affordable to the patients in need of our drugs”.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Eisai Vizag plant, one of Eisai’s factories, was established in Andhra Pradesh, India, in December, 2009. Eisai Vizag plant is a high-quality, low-cost manufacturing facility with high cost-competitiveness, supplying medicinal products mainly to emerging and developing countries. GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) audits, training and technology transfers by teams of experts mainly from Eisai Japan, as well as Eisai US and Eisai Europe are currently ongoing, as this plant also supplies products to developed world markets. It is also taking a role as the manufacturing site of the 2.2 billion diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) tablets, an anti-filarial medication which will be provided to WHO at “price zero” until 2020. The packaging label on the bottle is written in four languages (English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese) to make people living in at-risk communities comfortable with taking the medicine. Eisai plans to deliver this medicine through the WHO's lymphatic filariasis elimination program to some 250 million people in the developing world by 2020. 
Before establishing Eisai Vizag plant, Eisai specialists in the areas of manufacturing, quality control and plant design were selected. Eisai Vizag plant management personnel were then recruited in India and the plant was designed through many discussions among specialists from India and Japan. For manufacturing technology transfer, those highly competent in formulation development were selected from each of the three Eisai plants in Japan and sent to Vizag. Technology transfer documents, with the details of the manufacturing and testing methods and the regulatory approvals, provided from Eisai Japan to Eisai vizag plant, were very useful for smooth technology transfer. Frequent communications were begun among Vizag and other plants in Japan, the US and Europe in Eisai, mainly with regard to the specifications of raw materials, which significantly contributed to stable manufacturing of high quality products.
Lessons learned
Eisai staff with a strong sense of mission to provide high quality products at lower prices were actively involved and transferred sufficient knowledge and technology to Eisai Vizag plant, whose staff shared this sense of mission and responded well to expectations. To make technology transfer successful, a great deal of knowledge needs to be properly and effectively communicated.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Eisai received prequalification from the WHO for DEC 100 mg tablets manufactured at its Vizag Plant for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis, Eisai Vizag plant developed the formulation of DEC tablets from scratch, and Eisai conducted bioequivalence studies before submitting its application to the World Health Organization (WHO) for prequalification in October 2012. After a relatively smooth evaluation process, Eisai was able to receive prequalification for the DEC tablets less than 10 months from submission of the application. Finally, Eisai could begin the free supply of DEC tablets produced at its Vizag Plant in India to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in targeted developing and emerging countries in October 2013.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
HIV/AIDS remains among the greatest obstacles to women’s health and development. Although remarkable advances have been made in reducing new infections, progress has largely left women behind. In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, young women and adolescent girls ages 15 to 24 are as much as eight times as likely to be infected as their male counterparts. Since stopping HIV’s spread among women requires a range of options to meet women’s individual needs, new tools including microbicides and multipurpose prevention technologies are being developed.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The collaboration between Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) supports the development and delivery of innovative tools to enable women and girls in developing countries to protect themselves against sexual transmission of HIV.
This is done by granting IPM royalty-free license in order to develop and commercialize its HIV medicine in a number of developing countries and use its HIV medicine darunavir as a potential vaginal and rectal microbicide for HIV prevention in women.
This represents the first time a pharmaceutical company has licensed a protease inhibitor to be developed as a microbicide. The license will ultimately ensure that any new product will be provided at low cost in the settings where it is most urgently needed.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Pro Mujer is a twenty year old women’s development organization that seeks to alleviate poverty for poor women and their families in Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru through financial services, business and empowerment training and healthcare. The international women's development organisation has very effectively combined microfinance with healthcare provision, reaching approximately  1.250 million children and family members in some of the poorest communities in the countries where they operate.  Pro Mujer combats poverty by providing women with the resources and services they need to increase their income, maintain theirs and their childrens’ health, and achieve equality in their homes, work places and communities. 
Common health needs of poor women in these countries women are preventative approaches to minimise the impact of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and COPD caused by unhealthy lifestyle practices.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Building off the support GSK has provided to the strategic development plan in Argentina, this proposal recommends a three-year plan that would support Pro Mujer’s two major initiatives:
Standardization of a basic and financially self-sustainable global health services model based on providing screening for chronic diseases and primary care.
Focusing on screening and healthcare has a strong impact in countries where Pro Mujer currently operates since chronic illnesses account for 47-75% of the disease burden and health-related loss of productivity.
 Each country’s coverage on this initiative is monitored using the below indicators.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Many people are still dying of vaccine preventable diseases. One of the reasons is that health professionals often do not have the medical knowledge for the implementation of immunization programs.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
EpiVacPlus, the evolution of the EPIVAC® training program, involves training, research, and support activities in field epidemiology and applied vaccinology to strengthen immunization program performance and is one of the  Sanofi Pasteur contribution to the GAVI Alliance.
The program consists in a comprehensive, one year, on-the-job professional training program in epidemiology, applied computing, vaccinology and management of health programs for public health officers in West Africa. It culminates in an inter-university diploma in “Organization and Management for Public Immunization Programs in Developing Countries” awarded by the universities of Cocody Abidjan ( Ivory Coast) and Paris Dauphine ( France ).
The objective of the EpiVacPlus program is to train doctors involved in the implementation of immunization programs in 11 Central and West African countries. EPIVAC not only utilizes classroom, on-the-job training, and distance learning, it also combines two subjects which are usually taught separately: applied vaccinology and management sciences. Participants are trained while continuing to provide vital public health services to their communities, a teaching scheme that enables learning to put into practice immediately. 
In 2015/2016 Sanofi Pasteur provided the program with an additional 500,000 euro contribution to support new actions:
-The Preventive Medicine Agency has signed up with the University Flix Houphout-Boigny (Cte d'Ivoire), University of Abomey-Calavi (Benin), University of Lom (Togo), Polytechnic University of Bobo- Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), and University Paris-Dauphine (France), an interuniversity agreement for the creation of an International Master in Applied Vaccinology (MIVA).
-EpiVacPlus also includes the EpiVac.net African immunization network which is now composed of 11 national branches. It harnesses the expertise and skills of the EPIVAC training program participants and partners. These networks advocate for immunization interventions and share essential information regarding the success of immunization programs. They also raise awareness of the challenges facing countries to protect children against life-threatening or debilitating diseases.
Lessons learned
Sustainable development is not possible without access to vaccination. But drug availability is not enough and there is a deep need for health infrastructure. Regarding the immunization programs, the key factor for this improvement is the availability of trained and motivated health professionals.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 2002, more than 550 district medical officers have been trained and certified through the EpiVac program.
Sanofi Pasteur is also partnering with Gavi as Board Member, through the IFPMA.

In Russia, over 4.1 million diabetes patients are registered and the prevalence reaches 2.8% of the population (according to State registry of Diabetes patients as of January 2015). However, according to the NATION study conducted in 2013-2015, prevalence of type 2 diabetes reaches 5.4% which accounts for around 6 million Russian adults. Half of the Diabetes patients were not aware of their condition before the study. In addition, one out of five adult has prediabetes. Diabetes represents also a burden for physicians that do not have the time to educate patients during the visit. In addition, there is a low level implementation of national standard for Diabetes mellitus (DM) self-management to patients in most regions.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2009, Sanofi Russia developed and launched the educational program for patients “Every Day is Your Day!” in cooperation with leading experts. The partnership is designed to assist people with diabetes in reaching their treatment targets through providing them with training sessions and motivating them to manage their disease actively.
At the moment, the patient program includes: Diaspartakiada, the educational website Diabetes School (https://shkoladiabeta.ru/) and the 24-hour hotline Optiline. The Diaspartakiada, a unique sports and educational event, has been organized for children and teenagers with T1 diabetes since 2009. In partnership with the Russian Diabetes Association, it aims to provide children with diabetes a comprehensive support, kindle their interest in sport, develop their creative potential, and facilitate their psychological adjustment and socialization into society.
Since its initiation in autumn 2009, 160 educational events covering more than 18,000 patients have been organized in Russian regions. From 2012 to 2015 over 750 children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes from 60 Russian regions took part in Diaspartakiada.
In 2015, 6 Diaspartakiada were held - 300 children from 39 regions participated in them; 5,500 calls and 25,342 questions were addressed on the hotline; 100,000 visitors were recorded at the E-Diabetes School.
The feedback received from patients and endocrinologists that are participating in educational events organized within the program is positive. In addition, a high interest from patients has been given to e-diabetes.           
This program won the “Social Responsibility” category of the Gold Quill Awards in 2012.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Isolated indigenous communities in Brazil receive basic preventive health care from the government, but there are many operational difficulties related to difficult access to communities, serious cases, as well as elective surgeries depend on transfer to medical centers in the region.
In these regions there is a high incidence of degenerative eye diseases such as cataracts or pterygium, as well as hernias and other conditions that arise within a community that relies on their physical strength.
The lack of standards of care in medical centers is also a reality. Health centers do not always come with high-end technologies and medical experts generally deal with overcrowding. Thus, only the severe cases can be treated and the queue is long.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Expedicionários da Saúde (EDS) is a Brazilian non-profitable organization established in 2003 by a group of physicians who volunteered to bring specialty medical care and surgical care to isolated regions, benefiting indigenous populations. In 2012, this NGO gained Pfizer support, thus contributing to improve the infrastructure in indigenous communities, load transportation, logistics for the medical team, fuel to transport patients and with meals for patients and teams.
Lessons learned
Pfizer actively contributes in order to make each country and community in which it operates a better place to live and work. In Brazil, Pfizer has elected health education as the focus of its action in social projects, recognizing its talent and making available its experience and ability for enhancing people’s quality of life.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since February 2004, the organization provided 25,000 clinical examinations and conducted 4,431 surgeries on individuals of indigenous populations and to those living along Brazilian Amazon rivers. Furthermore, in 2010, after the earthquake in Haiti, EDS sent seven SOPS Haiti teams, performing 359 surgeries and 1,407 outpatient services.
In 2014, the NGO is seeking to perform three expeditions to Amazon. The first one happened in April in Xingu park, in the state of Maro Grosso. The group of volunteers provided 147 surgeries and more than 1,200 medical attendances.
Approximately 4,500 clinical examinations and 600 surgeries are expected to be provided this year.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
A new treatment is needed against malaria which is endemic in many developing countries, as some strains of malaria pathogens are resistant to existing anti-malarials. It is estimated that in 2010, malaria caused over 650,000 deaths, mostly among African children.
Description of partnership acvitivites and how they address needs and challenges
Eisai identified GWT1 as a target molecule in a development project for anti-fungals. Through joint research with Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), it was found that the GWT1 protein is an enzyme which catalyzes acyl group transfer reaction, an essential part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathways. Some of these antifungal candidates were then found to show antimalarial activity through the joint research with Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. Malaria research techniques, including the in vitro culture method and the animal experimental model, were transferred to Eisai from Kitasato Institute for further screening of antimalarial compounds in 2010.
In January, 2012, Eisai signed the material transfer agreement with Medicines for Malaria Venture in Switzerland for biological studies of antimalarial lead compounds.
Eisai and AIST successfully discovered a novel drug target in GPI biosynthesis pathway. Assays in Osaka University suggested the possibility of our anti-fungal compounds also acting on malaria pathogens with the same mechanisms. These results provided encouragement to start the current antimalarial project.
Lessons learnedIt is important to find the “triggering knowledge” at the start of new activities, although huge amounts of time and effort are needed to achieve this. Effective partnership with external specialists can shorten the time to start new activities and guide the research in a proper direction.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Eisai has clarified that its antimalarial compounds show sufficient antimalarial activities based on GWT1-inhibition, as shown by matching the results of the GWT1 assays (established with AIST) and the malaria assays. Together with partners the company is now moving towards lead optimization to create compounds with clinical usefulness. Collaborative activities between MMV and Eisai were explanded to evaluate compounds screened out.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria kills more people in Sierra Leone than any other disease and with only 240 medical practitioners covering a population of almost 6 million, access to malaria prevention information is limited.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Over the next year and a half GSK will contribute financial support of £780,000 to the Tony Blair Faith Foundation (TBFF) towards the cost of engaging faith communities to deliver education around five key malaria messages to 80% of households in Sierra Leone. The longer term aim will be to expand the innovative model to other countries in Africa.
Malaria kills more people in Sierra Leone than any other disease and with only 240 medical practitioners covering a population of almost 6 million, access to malaria prevention information is limited. However, Sierra Leone does have an extensive network of Muslim and Christian faith leaders who are at the center of everyday life, respected and listened to by their communities. 
TBFF’s innovative program, Faiths Act Sierra Leone, is a practical solution, through which leaders from different religious backgrounds come together to address the need for positive social change. It uses the social capital of faith communities to spread messages to even the most remote places – where there is almost always a church or mosque but not necessarily a medical clinic.
Since its launch in 2011, the Faiths Act program has already proven itself to be a cost effective and sustainable solution. The Tony Blair Faith Foundation has supported more than 529 Muslim and Christian leaders in Sierra Leone to train over 13,000 members of their congregations and volunteers within their communities. Nearly one third of the population (2 million people) have now been reached with malaria prevention advice through household visits.
Research by Ipsos MORI based on data between 2011 and 2012 found that the number of households that said they used nets frequently rose by 10%, the number of people storing away mosquito nets was reduced by 50% and fewer children are showing symptoms of malaria. While not only attributable to the Faiths Act program, this shows significant progress.
Lessons learned
The main challenges that have affected the FASL program over the past six months have largely been a result of the challenging infrastructure of working in the Sierra Leone context. These include limited access to some areas of operation due to bad roads and weather conditions, poor network coverage, fluctuating Internet access and lengthy travel periods to reach areas of operation. This has affected the program in the following ways:
Communication:  Challenges in reaching volunteers in some areas of operation, as the program expands to more rural districts. In addition, the ability to conduct comprehensive quality checks after the training is affected by the fact that some community volunteers (Malaria Faith Champions) do not own personal mobile phones. This has highlighted the need for a more hands on approach to monitoring the volunteers. The team have started doing spot checks to assess quality of work during their upcountry trips and stay for slightly longer periods to assist volunteers with any problem or issues that may arise. 
Monitoring and evaluation: Challenges in collecting timely data from rural and remote areas and those outside routes of current areas of operation. Since January 2014, the program has expanded to include the southern regions of Sierra Leone and this has affected the ability for the team to collect data at normal collection points, as travel is already extensive. The team have addressed this challenge by encouraging volunteers outside the current travel routes to send the data to the main office using various routes. 
Heavy workload: In the last quarter, the 3 dedicated program staff have been implementing the program in more hard to reach areas, i.e. the easternmost district of Kailahun which has meant longer travel times during working hours. Piloting the doubling of trained faith leaders has also highlighted the challenge of heavier workload for the FASL team, as this includes creating and transporting of a greater number of training materials to areas of operation. The team are currently working at full capacity to train and support faith leaders and their volunteers working in 5 districts across Sierra Leone.
To mitigate against some of the challenges mentioned above, a proposal is being developed to recruit and train co-ordinators who can collect data, ensure the quality of training and support given by the faith leaders. The coordinators will then pass on the collected data directly to FASL team in a timely manner. This will ease some of the pressure on the FASL team by creating a system for data to be collected from areas of operation in a systematic way and ensure quality of the training given by the MFAs. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since the beginning of GSK’s support (October 2013),  FASL has successfully achieved the following:
Trained 151 faith leaders as Malaria Faith Ambassadors to spear head public health messaging about malaria prevention in their communities (75 faith leaders in the northern districts of Sierra Leone and 77 in the South-Eastern District of Kailahun).
The Malaria Faith Ambassadors have in turn been supported to train over 4,430 community volunteers across Sierra Leone to conduct house to house visits, reaching over 450,000 people with lifesaving messages of malaria prevention through household visits.
A further 13,598 reached through other MFA led community activities.
This brings the total population reached since FASL began in 2011 to over 2 million people.
Impact of the program
Of the houses revisited, over 90% were found to have demonstrated positive behaviour change to promote malaria prevention as certified internally by volunteers.
In this reporting period, the program reached 7.5% of the total population of Sierra Leone with the life-saving messages of malaria prevention through household visits alone.
Recognising the vital role faith communities play in promoting positive behavioural change, the National Malaria Control program (NMCP) has agreed for our trained faith leaders to be present at distribution outlets and communities to conduct messaging on importance of ownership and proper use of treated nets in preventing malaria during the proposed June 2014 national bed net distribution campaign.

Familial clustering is popular among Chinese diabetes patients as related study shows that the Chinese are easy to develop into diabetes patients because they have diabetes susceptibility genes. Family members share similar lifestyles such as diet and living environment which makes familial clustering of diabetes possible. 
It’s important to establish a family based diabetes intervention, especially among those having diabetes patients already. To manage the disease and prevent complications, the timely communication between physicians and patients is necessary. Physicians should effectively guide patient’s self-care at home, and patients should tell their illness to physicians in a timely manner.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). It is found mainly in Latin America, primarily transmitted to humans by the faeces of triatomine bugs. The pathogen that causes the disease can also be transmitted by transfusions of infected blood, or from an infected mother to her unborn child.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) about ten million people are infected with Chagas disease worldwide and more than 10,000 die each year as a result. In endemic countries of Latin America where about 8 million people are infected, more than 25 million people are at risk of the disease. As part of increased migration and travelling with globalization, the disease is spreading to the U.S. and Europe.
Many are already infected in childhood, and children account for the majority of new infections of Chagas' disease. The pathogen is often transmitted by an infected mother to her newborn during pregnancy or childbirth. An effective treatment of infected women of child-bearing age and children – in addition to systematic screening and diagnosis – is therefore an important and effective lever in getting the disease under control.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Nifurtimox is one of only two approved treatments and included on the WHO’s list of ""Essential Medicines"". Bayer HealthCare, the manufacturer of nifurtimox, has given WHO a permanent supply guarantee for the drug. Bayer is also currently developing a pediatric formulation of Nifurtimox; a smaller nifurtimox tablet with a lower active ingredient content (30 mg) for weight-adjusted doses in children of all age groups. The aim of the CHICO study is to develop an appropriate, weight-adjusted dosing for newborn babies and children.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To combat Chagas’ disease, since 2004 Bayer has provided WHO with an annual donation of up to one million tablets of Lampit™ (active ingredient: nifurtimox 120 mg), along with an annual financial support of US$300,000 for logistics and distribution.
The CHICO study, which involves 390 pediatric patients including newborn babies, also aims to provide evidence for a shorter treatment duration. Chagas' disease is spreading beyond Latin America as a result of increased migration and travel. After successful completion of the study, Bayer therefore plans to register nifurtimox both in disease-endemic and in non-endemic countries with disease burden.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Fake medicines put patients and the general public at risk. Patients believe they are receiving genuine treatment, but instead they are getting potentially dangerous products that could increase resistance to real treatments, and cause further illness, disability or even death. Though it is a challenge to measure the scope of these dangerous products, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that fake medicines can account for up to 10% of medicines in the supply chain globally, and up to 30% of the drug supply chain in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Fake medicines may contain the wrong ingredients, the wrong dose, or no active ingredients at all; they can be long-standing or new medicines, over-the-counter or prescription, branded or generic. In some cases they contain dangerous substances and poisons including mercury, antifreeze, paint and rat poison.
Fake medicines used to treat communicable diseases such as malaria can also undermine entire public health initiatives by exposing communities to greater drug resistance. In Southeast Asia and sub Saharan Africa, 35% of anti-malarials failed chemical analysis, jeopardizing progress and investments in combatting this disease.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
 Fight the Fakes is a campaign that aims to raise awareness about the dangers of fake medicines. The campaign gives a voice to those who have been personally impacted and shares the stories of those working to put a stop to this threat to public health. It seeks to build a global movement of organizations and individuals who will shine light on the negative impact that fake medicines have on people around the globe and to reduce the negative consequences on individuals worldwide.
Fight the Fakes partners endorse the campaign and share the belief that coordination among all actors involved in the manufacturing and distribution of medicines is vital to tackle this public health threat.
As part of this effort, Fight the Fakes is collecting resources and updates on this issue and is encouraging the public to help speak up and spread the word about this threat to patients. The website also serves as a resource for organizations and individuals who are looking to support this effort by outlining opportunities for action and sharing what others are doing to fight fake medicines.
Fight the Fakes looks to the leadership of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Member State Mechanism on substandard/spurious/falsely-labelled/falsified/counterfeit medical products in guiding the direction of the campaign.
Since its launch in November 2013, Fight the Fakes has grown from 10 founding members to 33 partner organisations. This includes doctors, nurses, pharmacists, research institutes, NGOs and foundations, coalitions for consumer protection, product development partnerships (PDPs), disease-specific organizations, mobile app services, wholesalers and the researched-based and generic pharmaceutical industries. The Fight the Fakes website serves as a hub for resources about fake medicines, for updates on news, developments and technology, and for ‘stories from the frontline.’
The campaign has been represented by partners at events on drug regulation, malaria eradication, anti-counterfeiting, the role of the media in public health and the 69th World Health Assembly.   
Fight the Fakes has a growing presence on social media and has established itself as a key player in worldwide efforts against counterfeit medicines.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a parasitic disease in humans and animals transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease is endemic in countries of sub-Saharan Africa covering about 37 countries and 60 million people. In the Congo this infection now kills as many people as AIDS.
In 98% of cases HAT is caused by protozoa of trypanosoma brucei gambiense (t.b.g), found in 24 countries of West and Central Africa and in 2% of cases by trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (t.b.r.), found in 13 countries of Eastern and Southern Africa. While patients infected with t.b.g. usually emerge with symptoms after months and years in advanced stages of the disease, patients with t.b.r. present acute symptoms after only weeks or few months. Different types of treatment schemes are used for both patient groups.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 1997, the 50th World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to raise awareness of HAT and subsequently enhanced its efforts to fight HAT together with strong partners. In 2002, Bayer was among the first companies committing support to the World Health Organization (WHO) in fighting HAT. Over an inititial period of 10 years Bayer annually donated 10.000 vials of Germanin® (suramin) for the treatment of t.b.r. infected HAT patients. This agreement was renewed in 2008 for another five-year period and thereafter extended until 2017. WHO determines the requirements of Germanin® needed to meet the treatment needs.
The challenge remained to provide more effective and tolerable treatment for the majority of HAT patients infected with t.b.g. (98%). In 2003 began an extensive clinical study, first in the Republic of Congo and later in DRC, to explore a new treatment regimen, the Nifurtimox/Eflornithin Combination Therapy (NECT) involving Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Epicentre, the Special Program for Research & Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). Nifurtimox - the active ingredient of Lampit® - was originally used to treat Chagas disease only. The study ended in 2008 and results indicated that NECT shall become the new first-line treatment option for the majority of patients infected with t.b.g. in advanced stages of the disease. NECT is also a far more practical and shorter treatment than the previously available treatment options.
In the last 10 years, more than 80% of reported cases occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The DRC is the only country that currently reports more than 1000 new cases annually and thus carries the highest global disease burden of HAT. In 2013 Bayer decided to accelerate access to diagnosis and treatment of HAT by supporting the work of mobile intervention teams in the remote rural focal disease areas in DRC. Their work is critical for screening people at risk in focal disease areas, establish the correct diagnosis and refer patients to treatment. Furthermore they also create awareness for the disease and educate the villagers in rural areas on the symptoms.
In 2016 Bayer agreed with WHO to double the support of the mobile intervention teams in DRC until 2020 and further support training of healthcare providers as well as general education and awareness. Furthermore Bayer agreed to support surveillance and monitoring of HAT which is of particular importance when aiming for disease elimination.
Since 2016 these integrated activities are also complemented by the support of vector control in epidemic disease areas in DRC.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Currently some 83% of all reported cases of HAT worldwide occur in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2013 Bayer increased its commitment to the fight against African Sleeping Sickness, setting up a project for an initial period of three years during which Bayer will provide financial support for the work of mobile intervention teams deployed by the WHO in DR Congo to tackle local disease outbreaks. With the help of these teams, people in remote areas are gaining better access to diagnosis and treatment.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Buruli Ulcer is an infectious, disabling tropical disease recognized by the WHO as an emerging danger for public health. It mainly affects children aged under 15, and causes irreversible mutilation when it escapes early detection. Buruli Ulcer is the third most frequent mycobacteriosis after tuberculosis and leprosy. The disease propagates in stagnant or marshy water, and seems to be caused by bites from certain aquatic insects. Buruli Ulcer mainly affects poor communities in rural environments involved in agricultural work.
The World Bank estimates that among people living below the poverty line 1 in 5 is disabled. Disability creates additional costs, resulting in loss of income, restricts access to health, education, employment, and community life, and forces people with disabilities and limited resources into social and economic exclusion.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Sanofi Espoir Foundation partnered with the NGO Handicap International in Togo and Benin to fight Buruli Ulcer. The actions on the ground in support of the country’s Ministry of Health and local stakeholders involved community awareness-raising, training health professionals, the detection and early management of patients, and rehabilitating those with disabilities.Lessons learned
Development programs, set up by NGOs together with local government representatives can play a very important role on the national health policy.
Example: Handicap International Togo, helped by its partners, has developed since 2007 a series of actions to step up the anti-Buruli Ulcer program in Togo currently lagging behind those in neighboring Benin and Ghana. As a result of all these initiatives, the National Buruli Ulcer, Leprosy and Plan Program developed a policy document and a five-year plan to fight Buruli Ulcer.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
As a result of the pilot project (2008-2010) in the coastal region, 202 new cases were detected, 109 of them confirmed as Buruli Ulcer by the PCR – a confirmation rate of 54%.
In 2011, this program was extended to a second coastal region in Togo and Benin, with the transfer of skills in motor physiotherapy and rehabilitating people with disabilities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The Gran Chaco region, which extends to Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay, is hyper-endemic for Chagas disease.. Despite an ongoing regional campaign to eliminate Chagas disease conducted by the ‘Southern Cone Initiative,’ the transmission (mediated through the vector Triatoma infestans) persists in much of the Gran Chaco.
The system for monitoring the vector of Chagas disease is incipient. There are also communication difficulties with the diversity of languages spoken by ethnic groups in addition to the conditions of extreme poverty in which they live.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Sanofi Espoir Foundation and the Sanofi Paraguayan affiliate have supported SAIB association since 2011, with a project focusing on 4 of the Paraguayan Chaco's indigenous communities, which were reinfested by Chaga’s vectors after chemical spraying. The project established a reporting system in the communities through early detection of the presence of vectors with pre-tested devices with semio chemicals that attract indoor vectors. Early detection allows for rapid elimination of threats to re-infestation.
The program also built a body of knowledge aimed at developing multisectorial strategies for sustainable control and surveillance based on principles of participatory environmental management. Constructed around several pillars, the partnership aimed to:
Control the disease by constructing model houses based on an ecosystem approach, a gendered perspective and factoring ethnic diversity in the region. Model houses have walls and ceilings that eliminate entry points for the vector and use the roof for water collection, leading to healthy and environmentally friendly households.
Monitor the disease by design and implementing sustainable vector surveillance models based on the ecosystem perspective of participating communities, accompanied by actions to strengthen tools for early detection of re-infestation of the vector for Chagas disease via peri-domestic or wild vector populations
Reduce the burden of the disease by strengthening local health services diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease, and through public-private partnerships which strengthen the actions and capacities of government agencies and local leaders
Strengthen the school as the gateway to the control of Chagas disease by involving students in vector surveillance
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The intent of this support was for community leaders to learn how to negotiate with national authorities to gain aid for their communities and how to organize themselves in a common objective.
The participatory approach to this project enabled, education and the incorporation of preventive measures against the disease and against other housing-related and environmental factors. With help from the group of investigators, the community leaders have met with the Ministry for Social Action to request food aid for their communities and participate in development projects for family Gardens.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Leishmaniasis is endemic in 88 countries and even though it affects nearly 2 million new patients each year transmitted by a tiny phlebotomine sand-fly, it is still among the world’s neglected diseases.
For years it has been classified as a disease restricted to forest and then peri-rural areas, leishmaniasis is now moving towards urban areas and unless it is effectively monitored, it will become a new burden to large cities that are already facing other epidemics such as dengue fever. As deforestation expands, the mosquito which transmits leishmaniasis will find a host in dogs and endanger the lives of the whole family.
Between 1980 and 2005, Brazil recorded 671,225 cases of leishmaniasis (visceral + skin), and the Northern and North-East Region account together for more than 70% of the cases. Both forms of the disease account for 3% of the cases and 1% of the deaths due to all infectious diseases that receive compulsory notification in Brazil.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In a partnership with the Sanofi Espoir Foundation, the Aggeu Magalhães Research Center (attached to the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) launched a monitoring and care program in 2003, in close cooperation with five municipalities in the Pernambuco region to assess the epidemiology of leishmaniasis. This program built on 3 actions lines to boost the effectiveness of treatment:
Training technicians and community health workers to carry out early detection
Transporting patients and monitoring treatment
Supporting collective action to prevent the disease
The work is being carried out in close collaboration with city halls, as these manage the Family Health Program and lead prevention campaigns in schools. It is vital to mobilize all players to ensure that patients are transported as soon as possible to reference centers, where they can be accurately diagnosed and receive closely monitored treatment.Summary of impact and forward looking information
Through the program designed by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, and its large database on the disease’s epidemiology, this initiative will act as a model for similar projects in other endemic regions and will help set up a national plan to sight leishmaniasis, which has already been diagnosed in nearly 2,700 towns and cities across the country.
Since the beginning of the program, 824 health professionals (doctors and veterinarians) have been trained. In Brazil, Sanofi produces a drug against leishmaniasis which is provided at a preferential price in affected countries. More than 6 million doses have been distributed in 20156. Today it is administered by injection only, but Sanofi is working to develop a new formulation for skin application.
The program is currently ongoing with a Sanofi Brazil affiliate, and has been extended to the area around Baturrite, west of Fortaleza.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease that affects the hemoglobin red blood cells. It affects nearly 120 million people worldwide, yet few of them are aware of its existence or even know they have it. Sickle cell disease is a major public health problem because it is widespread in the African Region where the abnormal gene has a prevalence of between 2% and 30%, which explains the high mortality and morbidity due to this illness.
In most countries, it is a serious disease responsible for many deaths of children aged under 5. From 25 to 50% of homozygous children die before they are two and only 5 to 10% of them reach adulthood. The survivors are still vulnerable to outbreaks of the disease and its complications.
In Madagascar, there is an estimated 9% global prevalence of sickle cell disease. Most deaths due to complications of the disease are found in children under five, adolescents and pregnant women.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The project carried out by the LCDM association in partnership with the Sanofi Espoir Foundation is primarily focused on outreach in towns and villages in ten regions covered by the national program against sickle cell disease.
A number of actions are being implemented:
Education and awareness about the prevention of risk factors of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in sickle cell disease, especially among children under five.
Educating people about simple hygiene, nutrition and care actions to help treat sickle cell disease.
Training healthcare professionals and paramedics to treat sickle cell disease more effectively from an early age at the onset of first sickle cell crises.
Raising the awareness of partners and local NGOs about access to water, and front line therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
Lessons learned
Many different stakeholders, included the Ministry of Health must be involved in a global approach so that initiatives in the field will be successful.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In India, a family where one member has tuberculosis will lose 30 to 60% of its income depending on whether the victim is working. In poor and densely populated areas of a large city such as Mumbai, where 3% of the population has tuberculosis (3 new patients each year for every 1,000 inhabitants), it is one of the leading causes of death, disability and unemployment.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Foundation supports the program of the NGO Inter Aide to help health authorities and local stakeholders reduce the economic impact and risk of tuberculosis infection in the slums of Mumbai.
The program provides capacity for public health centres to improve care and patient monitoring, reduce regimen non-compliance, and drive up the cure rate. The teams visit private doctors in slums to encourage them to send their patients to public or association-based centres where treatment will be given free of charge. They set up centres to deliver DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) inside the slums (49 centres work with support from the Indian authorities). They are conducting awareness campaigns to alert people to the risks of this disease.
Lessons learned
Many different stakeholders must be involved in a global approach so that initiatives in the field will be successful.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2013, 324,000 people benefited from awareness-raising actions. The same year, 4,889 patients were screened and put on treatment in the DOTS centres set up under this program, and 2,596 patients were channelled to various private and public centres due to awareness raising actions by doctors working in shanty towns.
The program’s success has been recognized by Indian health authorities, and the government plans to replicate the project in other regions, applying the Inter aide model.

There is a high prevalence of TB among young children and co-infected patients. In Uganda, fifty (50%) percent of TB patients are HIV positive and 30 % of AIDS-related deaths there are attributed to TB.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2007, Amref Health Africa have been working with AstraZeneca on a project to help tackle the ""big three"" diseases; malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB. Despite evident links between these three major diseases, an integrated approach to manage the problem had not been attempted in Uganda before.
As well as helping to strengthen support services, such as laboratory services, transport systems and drugs, the project also looks to improve successful treatment of TB by training community health workers to support TB patients to take their drugs correctly.
Lessons learned
The Village Health Team model had a greater than expected impact in linking patients to services. Detailed needs assessment with involvement of stakeholders at the start was key to determining best interventions. A broad approach directed the project to fundamental capacity building with strong leverage beyond the initial disease scope.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information 
Over 1,100 village health teams were trained as well as a number of highly skilled lab technicians. 100,000 people across the two districts were educated about the three diseases, either by peer educators or through outreach days within schools and communities.
Hospital Admissions for and mortality from malaria halved; uptake of HIV testing increased 49%, HIV positivity down from 6.7% to 4.4%. There was a four-fold increase in TB testing with TB mortality down from 2.4% to 0.24%.

Torrential rains began in Pakistan in August 2011. Compounded by damage to the country’s water infrastructure, particularly to dams, that had occurred during the floods of 2010 the situation quickly worsened and by mid-September the United Nations reported that 5.3 million people had been impacted by the monsoon rains across the country.
Description of partnership activities and how they meet needs and challenges
The Sanofi Espoir Foundation provided financial support to Première-Urgence - Aide Médicale Internationale (PU-AMI) for activities in the Sindh Province, ensuring access to primary healthcare and making drinking water available.
The main activities plan included:
Primary healthcare examinations using mobile clinics, collecting epidemiological data and epidemiological surveillance, health education, and distributing tents and mosquito nets.
Setting up water and sanitation facilities to supply drinking water using the water production unit from the MAE.
The distribution of basic non-food products, including tents and mosquito nets, to back up the consistency and relevance of the aid activities mentioned above.
Sanofi Pakistan was approached by the Sindh government with an urgent request for the Group’s anti-malarial drug, Nivaquine®, as doctors and officers working with the impacted populations had specifically identified the need for this particular product. The affiliate responded swiftly, donating 3,800 boxes of Nivaquine® for healthcare programs.
Lessons learned
Healthcare is one the most vital needs in humanitarian disasters. Organizations and their partners have to act quickly, but only after having evaluated the population’s needs, and coordinating with other NGO/health authorities acting on the field. 
Emergency activities have to be followed by more long term actions as the crisis still continues for months, even for years following.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
In 2011, 200,000 patients benefited from Sanofi Nivaquine’ donations. A futher 24,000 people were assisted by PU-AMI emergency activities.

Birth asphyxia— an inability to breathe at birth — happens with approximately one out of every 10 babies. Birth asphyxia is a major cause of infant mortality and can contribute to developmental issues such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Johnson & Johnson has programs that address birth asphyxia in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa, Uganda and Vietnam. The largest of these is China’s Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), also known as Freedom of Breath, Fountain of Life.  Since 2010, professionals and other birth attendants trained through these programs have touched the lives of more than 12.6 million women and children. Johnson & Johnson is committed to continue to focus on providing hands-on training to local hospitals and clinics to reduce mortality in situations where basic training can save a life.
How challenges are addressed by the partnership activities:
Nurses, as both clinical partners and NRP trainers, are a key element in the program’s success and scale-up. The success of the program has led to a policy change in China. Now, neonatal resuscitation certification is a professional requirement for nurses, midwives and obstetricians working in labor and delivery.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
Since the program launched in 2004, neonatal mortality caused by birth asphyxia has declined in China by more than 53 percent, based on evaluated program sites in 20 target provinces (each of which has more than 20,000 hospitals). The NRP in China has saved more than 90,000 babies in its first five years and cut birth asphyxia deaths by almost half in 360 evaluated hospitals.
In 2010, Johnson & Johnson committed to extending the reach of the NRP until 2015.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
With 20% of the world's children not vaccinated, the GAVI Alliance is seeking to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. Each year, 1.7 million children die from a vaccine-preventable disease. The overwhelming majority of these deaths occur in developing countries. That's one life every 20 seconds. Twenty-three million children in developing countries do not receive life-saving vaccines that parents in wealthy nations take for granted.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The GAVI Alliance was founded in 2000 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the WHO, UNICEF and vaccine manufacturers, including Sanofi Pasteur, Pfizer, MSD, GSK, Novartis, and Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies (previouslly called Crucell) of Johnson & Johnson. Committed to saving children’s lives and protecting people’s health through the widespread use of vaccines, GAVI’s driving objective is to make a critical contribution to global immunization goals by supporting immunization programs and health systems, and accelerating the introduction of new vaccines.
GAVI addresses three critical gaps in the provision of vaccines:
between children for whom immunization is a given and the 23.2 million children worldwide with no access to vaccines;
between the introduction of a new vaccine in rich countries and the average 10-15 years required for the same vaccine to reach low-income countries;
between the need for new vaccines in developing countries and the lack of research and funds to provide them.
GAVI supports new and underused vaccines, health system strengthening, immunization services, injection safety and civil society organizations In total, GAVI has committed USD 7.2 billion since 2000. Eighty (80) percent has been committed towards the purchase of vaccines. The GAVI Fund provides financial support to low-income countries, based upon applications to and recommendations by the GAVI Alliance Board. Besides, industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. They also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.
The GAVI Alliance has also organized a major initiative to contain the risk of yellow fever epidemics. Since 2003, the Group has provided more than six million doses per year of yellow fever vaccines funded by GAVI to go toward emergency stockpiles of vaccines, in order to prevent epidemics in Africa.
Other challenges include: ensuring contributions of all the Board partners; GAVI and Industry constituency governance processes and transparency, management of COI (conflict of interest), improving demand forecast by GAVI to help industry align supply projections, and risk management by GAVI to ensure that funds are properly used in countries. UNICEF policy of supply security and contracts with manufacturers allows for minimal, if any, interruption of immunization programs, Coordination within the Global Vaccine Policy WG (including formal governance procedure related to GAVI work) ensures that all individual companies contribute their knowledge and positions, and all voices are heard and communicated.
GAVI achievements in 2015:
Average child mortality in Gavi-supported countries fell from 76 to a projected 63 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2010 and 2015, an unprecedented rate of reduction of 3.6% per year.
By helping countries to avert more than 4 million future deaths between the start of 2011 and the end of 2015, Gavi exceeded its target of 3.9 million for the five-year period. In addition, Gavi-funded measles vaccine campaigns conducted between 2013 and 2015 are estimated to have averted more than 300,000 future deaths. Since Gavi was set up in 2000, we have contributed to averting more than 8 million future deaths in developing countries.
By the end of 2015, 277 million children had been immunised with Gavi-supported vaccines relative to the end of 2010. This means that the Vaccine Alliance surpassed its target of immunising an additional 243 million children during the 2011–2015 period across all our routine vaccine programmes. Since our inception in 2000, we have supported countries in immunising close to 580 million children.
Industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. They also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.
Janssen activities 
Janssen support for GAVI includes supplying large quantities of the first internationally available thiomersal-preservative free, fully liquid pentavalent (5-in-1) vaccine Quinvaxem™, which protects children against 5 diseases (DTP-HepB-Hib) in one single shot. Since 2006, Janssen supplied more than 270 million doses of Quinvaxem™ to the world's poorest countries at discounted prices, including consistent supply when other pentavalent vaccines manufacturers were unable to do so.
From 2011 to 2014 Janssen's CEO represented the Industrialized Countries Vaccine Manufacturers constituency on the GAVI Board. From 2008 to 2011 janssen served on the GAVI Program & Policy Committee.
GlaxoSmithKline activities
GSK is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of vaccines: in 2013, they distributed over 860 million doses of vaccines to some 170 countriesa and 80% of these vaccines were delivered to people low income and middle income countries. For the last decade,GSK  has been the primary supplier of vaccines to UNICEF which purchases vaccines on behalf of GAVI. The GAVI Alliance benefits from GSK’s lowest prices as part of its tiered pricing approach. This approach is designed to support those countries which commit to vaccination for the long term and implement programs aimed at reaching large proportions of the target population. Tiered pricing reflects the fundamental value of immunisation as an investment in health. It also reflects GSK’s desire to enable countries to maintain and expand upon their commitment to immunisation as their economies grow. For the least well-off countries, GSK works closely with GAVI and UNICEF to improve access to vaccines.
In 2016, as a demonstration of GSK’s commitment to increase access to vaccines that can help save children’s lives in the world’s poorest countries, GSK offered a further eduction in the price of its pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix, to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. GSK has a portfolio of more than 30 vaccines; these include vaccines against cervical cancer, rotavirus and pneumococcal disease, each of them highly innovative and each supported by GAVI. 
In 2014, GSK announced that it would freeze the prices of its vaccines for five years for developing countries that graduate from GAVI Alliance support.
In 2013, a 2 dose schedule of GSK’s Cervarix was licensed in Europe and some other countries for girls 9-14 years. Many countries face significant challenges in implementing national immunisation programmes in young adults and so a two-dosing schedule has the potential to be easier to deliver than a three-dose schedule.
Since 2002 GSK has supported the work of the Network for Education and Support in Immunization (NESI) to promote vaccinology training for healthcare workers in sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East. NESI has become a key partner of organizations such as the WHO, UNICEF and GAVI who implement vaccination programs in these regions.   In Sudan, GSK contributed to the introduction of the Rotarix vaccine by supporting social mobilization and training in partnership with the Ministry of Health. In Zambia, GSK supported the Program for the Awareness and Elimination of Diarrhea by donating Rotarix to vaccinate over 84,000 children in the District of Lusaka. This pilot project should be leveraged to develop capacity for national co-introduction of rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines. GSK has also Cervarix, cervical cancer vaccine, which will be made available in developing countries with help from GAVI. GSK also is developing new vaccines for diseases which are future GAVI targets, including dengue and malaria.
MSD activities 
MSD aims to achieve the broadest possible access to our vaccines within a sustainable framework—one that allows ongoing research, development, and distribution of innovative vaccines that address important unmet health needs. We do so through a comprehensive strategy that includes working with governments to build vaccination delivery programs that reliably reach people and also tiered (or differential) pricing–systematically pricing vaccines at differing levels appropriate to the value they create under the economic conditions where they are used–to facilitate broad access.
MSD has supplied over 4 million doses of GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and over 18 million doses of ROTATEQ® (rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, pentavalent) to Gavi through UNICEF from 2012-2016. 
In low-income countries, MSD offers ROTATEQ and GARDASIL at an access price that is the lowest available price in the world. The access price is exclusive to the public sectors of Gavi-eligible countries meeting the needs of the developing world by facilitating access to these innovative vaccines in the poorest countries, while making sure they remain affordable and sustainable in the long term.  For more developed middle-income countries, MSD practices differential pricing that considers many factors, including countries' ability to pay and others.
MSD is committed to working with partners, including Gavi, to improve access to GARDASIL and ROTATEQ in developing countries.  
In 2015, MSD committed to Gavi to extend its 2015 Gavi prices for GARDASIL and ROTATEQ to Gavi graduated countries. This renewed commitment to Gavi enables these countries to achieve continued access to our vaccines for 10 years (21016-2025).
In 2010, in partnership with the Government of Bhutan, the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation, MSD began providing GARDASIL to eligible girls in the country.  More than 90% of targeted girls were vaccinated with three doses of the vaccine in the first year of the program.
In 2011, in a partnership with the Government of Rwanda, MSD began providing GARDASIL to , as part of a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention that included both HPV vaccination and HPV DNA testing.  More than 96% of targeted girls were vaccinated with three doses of GARDASIL in 2011 and 2012.  This program has now fully transitioned to Gavi support. In addition, MSD through its partnership with Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) continues to work to address cervical cancer in sub-Saharan Africa through comprehensive approaches to cervical cancer prevention and control, including HPV vaccination.  This effort includes a program launched in coordination with the Zambian government, local NGOs, the US government and PRRR partners, focused on the scale up of breast and cervical cancer education to increase knowledge and awareness and reduce stigma throughout Zambia.  MSD also supported the Zambian Ministry of Health’s plans to conduct an HPV vaccine demonstration project across the province of Lusaka by providing 180,000 doses of GARDASIL to vaccinate 50,000 eligible girls over two years, and provided technical support for the program. Plans are underway by the Zambian government to transition to a national HPV vaccination program with Gavi support.
From 2006-2009, MSD worked with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health on an innovative partnership to vaccinate all infants born in Nicaragua during this time period against rotavirus.  This program, which was completed in 2009 and transitioned to Gavi funding in 2010, achieved an estimated 94 percent vaccine coverage (with 3 doses) among Nicaraguan infants.  MSD continues to participate in UNICEF tender to supply Gardasil and RotaTeq to developing countries with Gavi support.  MSD’s partnership with Gavi and other Alliance partners is helping to ensure that infants and girls in the poorest countries have sustainable access to these vaccines.
Pfizer activities 
In March 2010, Pfizer entered into the first of three 10-year supply agreements under the terms of the AMC to supply 300M doses of PCV 13 for pneumococcal disease (PD). Subsequently, Pfizer entered into two additional agreements with the AMC expanding its commitment with an additional 440 million doses, for a total commitment of 740 million doses of the first 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine until 2025.
In addition to expanding its commitment, Pfizer further reduced the AMC “tail price” price for Prevenar 13 to $3.40 for 2013 and $3.30 for all subsequent years through 2025. The AMC is a public-private health funding program designed to create a sustainable marketplace, ensure an affordable and stable supply of pneumococcal vaccines at a steeply discounted price and stimulate the development and expansion of manufacturing capacity for vaccines specifically for the world's poorest countries.  Pfizer was proud to introduce its vaccine into the childhood immunization program of a developing country within one year of its launch in the United States and European Union — a historic precedent given the average 10–15 year lag for introducing newer vaccines into developing countries following their introduction in industrialized nations. As of December 2013, Prevenar 13 is now available in 40 GAVI eligible countries.
Nicaragua, the first GAVI country to launch a PCV vaccine, has demonstrated a reduction of infant mortality by 33% just two years after launch.  Pfizer is proud to be a partner in the GAVI Alliance and to contribute to the reduction of infant mortality and to help avert over 500,000 future deaths from pneumococcal disease by 2015.
Sanofi activities
Sanofi Pasteur is a longstanding partner of GAVI in the supply of several  vaccines. In light of GAVI decisions to support implementation of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization, this partnership has expanded further via the supply of unparalleled quantities of affordable IPV to support rapid & widespread adoption of the vaccine across 73 of the world’s poorest countries, hand-in-hand with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) - another key public-private partnership spearheaded by WHO.
Sanofi Pasteur is a leading supplier of Yellow Fever vaccines, used in ICG (International Coordination Group) funded vaccines stockpile for emergency outbreak response, for mass campaigns and routine use in Africa and Latin America.  Shantha biologics - a Sanofi company - supplies a well adapted fully liquid ready-to-use oral vaccine against cholera, recognised as an important tool in the control of this disease which is estimated to  kill up to 100 000 people every year, around half of whom are in Africa.  The GAVI Alliance financed the supply of vaccine for outbreak situations and campaigns in areas of recurring disease in 2014. Shantha's pentavalent paediatric combination vaccine, DTP-HepB-Hib is added to the list of manufacturers able and ready to supply pre-qualified a key vaccine in GAVI's strategy.
Part of Sanofi Pasteur’s contribution to the GAVI Alliance is its support of the EpiVacPlus program. Implemented by the Agence de Médecine Préventive (AMP), all program activities are implemented in collaboration with governments of partner countries, international health organizations, and African and European universities. In this way, EpiVacPlus constitutes an effective international, public-private partnership, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving immunization program performance. The program trains doctors involved in the implementation of immunization programs in eleven Central and West African countries.  By providing medical personnel with crucial training in epidemiology, applied computing, vaccinology, and management of health programs, this diploma course in organization and management of immunization in developing countries will help improve access to vaccines.
GAVI addresses three critical gaps in the provision of vaccines:
between children for whom immunization is a given and the 23.2 million children worldwide with no access to vaccines;
between the introduction of a new vaccine in rich countries and the average 10-15 years required for the same vaccine to reach low-income countries;
between the need for new vaccines in developing countries and the lack of research and funds to provide them. 
GAVI supports new and underused vaccines, health system strengthening, immunization services, injection safety and civil society organizations In total, GAVI has committed USD 7.2 billion since 2000. Eighty (80) percent has been committed towards the purchase of vaccines. The GAVI Fund provides financial support to low-income countries, based upon applications to and recommendations by the GAVI Alliance Board. Besides, industry partners invest in the development of new vaccines and in enhanced global vaccine manufacturing capacity, including facilities in developing countries. They also help to educate healthcare providers and develop technologies to facilitate vaccine distribution.
The GAVI Alliance has also organized a major initiative to contain the risk of yellow fever epidemics. Since 2003, the Group has provided more than six million doses per year of yellow fever vaccines funded by GAVI to go toward emergency stockpiles of vaccines, in order to prevent epidemics in Africa.
Other challenges include: ensuring contributions of all the Board partners; GAVI and Industry constituency governance processes and transparency, management of COI (conflict of interest), improving demand forecast by GAVI to help industry align supply projections, and risk management by GAVI to ensure that funds are properly used in countries. UNICEF policy of supply security and contracts with manufacturers allows for minimal, if any, interruption of immunization programs, Coordination within the Global Vaccine Policy WG (including formal governance procedure related to GAVI work) ensures that all individual companies contribute their knowledge and positions, and all voices are heard and communicated.
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
Average child mortality in Gavi-supported countries fell from 76 to a projected 63 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2010 and 2015, an unprecedented rate of reduction of 3.6% per year.
By helping countries to avert more than 4 million future deaths between the start of 2011 and the end of 2015, Gavi exceeded its target of 3.9 million for the five-year period. In addition, Gavi-funded measles vaccine campaigns conducted between 2013 and 2015 are estimated to have averted more than 300,000 future deaths. Since Gavi was set up in 2000, we have contributed to averting more than 8 million future deaths in developing countries.
By the end of 2015, 277 million children had been immunised with Gavi-supported vaccines relative to the end of 2010. This means that the Vaccine Alliance surpassed its target of immunising an additional 243 million children during the 2011–2015 period across all our routine vaccine programmes. Since our inception in 2000, we have supported countries in immunising close to 580 million children.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Infectious diseases impose the major health burden in low-and-middle income countries. There is a desperate need for effective, affordable and accessible vaccines to combat these neglected infectious diseases that affect over two billion people in the developing world. Novartis is committed to improving global health and the Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH) is an important part of that strategy as they discover and develop vaccines specifically addressing the needs of developing countries.
A major bottleneck in the path to new vaccines is the expertise and facilities needed to turn a laboratory concept into high quality vaccines that are both clinically effective and economically viable for manufacture. The role of GENRIVAX is to bridge that gap by applying expertise to the translational research required to move a laboratory concept through development to the proof of concept in the clinic and then transferring this knowledge to the eventual manufacturer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The aim of the GENDRIVAX (GENome-DRIVen Vaccine) scientific program is to develop novel prophylactic vaccines against invasive bacterial diseases caused by Salmonella and Neisseria.
GENDRIVAX is a collaboration between the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI), the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (STPHI), the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH).
These four partners bring together academic innovation with industrial expertise through joint training and exchange initiatives.
GENDRIVAX states that central to its progam is the concept that bacteria that infect humans are under strong selection pressure and that this has major impacts on vaccine strategies:
Vaccines design needs to address issues of antigenic diversity to ensure that a novel vaccine covers the major circulating serotypes of the pathogens.
Since target of protective immunity are under strong pressure, understanding the diversity of pathogen components gives important information about targets of natural immunity.
A successful vaccine will put new selection pressure on pathogens and understanding the population dynamics of pathogens will help design vaccines that minimize the risk of the emergence of vaccine resistant pathogens.
Through its affiliation with NVGH, the project has access to an impressive array of high technology equipment and expertise. Of particular relevance is the proteomics facility that enables detailed analysis of proteins present in OMB and the FACS facility for analysing the binding of antibodies generated against OMB to the bacterial surface. Novartis Vaccines also provides the facilities required for daily operation including extensive computer facilities, library facilities, and the human resource facility with dedicated staff to facilitate exchange programs including obtaining visas, assistance with housing, language training and more.
On 2 March 2015, Novartis announced the completion of a series of transactions with GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), including the divestiture of the Novartis non-influenza Vaccines business to GSK.

            What are the needs and challenges? 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease, and can cause Lupus Nephritis (LN), an inflammation of the kidney. In SLE patients, in addition to the kidney, other tissues and organs can be affected, including the skin, the nervous system, or joints.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This collaboration of EMD Serono, subsidiary of Merck, and Pfizer, is focused on the genomic profiling of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Lupus Nephritis (LN) patients.
As part of the collaboration, the Broad Institute will investigate clinical samples obtained from SLE and LN patients, applying biochemical and next-generation sequencing technologies. They will also analyze immune cell subpopulations. The goal is to identify biomarkers to better define target patient populations for future therapies. In addition, through computational modeling approaches, the project aims to identify key molecular drivers of SLE and LN kidney flares, and thereby to discover potential novel drug targets as the basis for innovative therapies.
Under the terms of the agreement, EMD Serono and Pfizer, as sponsoring members, will receive real-time access to all data and analysis. In addition, both companies will have the ability to send a research scientist to the Broad Institute to foster exchange of technology expertise in the area of computational and experimental genomic profiling.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Access to healthcare for people in low- and middle-income countries is challenging. Patients in remote areas of Ghana face geographical barriers to health services – including poor transport networks, limited access to healthcare providers, and inadequately resourced health facilities – and experience high mortality and morbidity rates for diseases that may be easily treated. For patients in the Bonsaaso cluster in the Amansie-West District of the Ashanti Region, traveling to access medical services and consultation could be as far as 40 kilometers.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To deliver better quality care at the place where people need it, the Novartis Foundation pioneered a telemedicine model in Ghana, together with several partners.
The telemedicine model is developed around the frontline health worker, with digital technology allowing for the centralization of healthcare expertise. The doctors, experienced nurses and midwives, who are staffing the teleconsultation center at the referral hospital 24/7, are coaching and guiding less-skilled community health workers in their patient care. This not only empowers community health workers, it also improves quality of care with a direct impact on patient health outcomes. In 2016 for example, more than half of all teleconsultations could be resolved directly by phone, including 31% that avoided referrals.
Lessons learned                         
Telemedicine in Ghana is one of many examples that demonstrate the value of digital health in improving healthcare systems in developing countries. ICTs have the potential to address several of the health challenges facing developing countries by providing cost-effective solutions. 
Digital health solutions help to better connect people around the world – be they health workers in remote areas that need to consult with their peers and doctors, or patients that need to connect with medical specialists for advice.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The initiative is now successfully scaling throughout Ghana. This is fully attributable to the strong local ownership of the Ghana health authorities, who quickly saw the true potential of this telemedicine model because of its simplicity, efficiency and impact. The model was pioneered in the Amansi West region by the joint efforts of the Ghana Ministry of Health, the Ghana Health Service, the National Health Insurance Authority, the Ambulance Services of Ghana, Millennium Promise and the Novartis Foundation. It has been selected by the health authorities, out of seven other telemedicine models piloted in Ghana, as the preferred option to be implemented throughout the country. National roll-out has already started, with telemedicine services currently covering 25 districts in five regions. In 2017, the Ghana Health Service will also be installing telemedicine services in the greater Accra region, with the goal to reach national coverage by the end of the year.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In Ghana only 14% of the people have access to improved water and sanitation facilities. The country lacks infrastructure able to ensure efficient waste management, safe drinking water and urban water management.
Most of the schools in Ghana have poor maintenance of facilities which results in unacceptable hygienic conditions. Under these conditions, schools become unsafe places where diseases are easily transmitted in-between children and their families creating also a negative impact on the overall development.
In the country, different WASH projects aimed at improving wash facilities at schools have already been carried out, but these have underestimated the importance of social and sustainable outcomes. In order to secure sustainability, local ownership must be created within and around the schools.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In partnership with Vitens Evides International, the School Health Education Program, Professional Footballers Association of Ghana, ProNet and WorldCoach, Merck is cooperating to improve WASH facilities and WASH behavior at 100 schools in five municipalities in Ghana (Ga Central, Ga South, Ga West, Cape Coast and KEEA).
This public private partnership is a life-style program linking water, sanitation and hygiene with football. Sports and competition inspire, commit and educate male and female World-Coaches about the importance of good WASH behavior. In the project the coaches will be trained and schools will be enabled to manage football and wash facilities sustainably.
The activities include the implementation of WASH and football infrastructures, the creation of capacity development for knowledge institutionalisation and the launch and upscaling of school football.
This public private partnership's goals are:
70,000 children directly reached and educated on better WASH practices
100 schools with improved WASH facilities
200 WorldCoaches trained at 100 schools
30 improved soccer pitches/ open sport places
100 schools with incorporation of good WASH practices and programmes, with local ownership
WASH soccer competition for the schools

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Breast cancer is among the most acute women's health problems in Russia. Around 61,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed every year whereas the annual mortality is 23,000. In Russia, only a limited number of patients receive timely treatment. Due to this reason the five-year survival rate after diagnosis is no more than 59.5% (compared to 89.4% in the US). 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2010, Sanofi Russia, in cooperation with the leading Russian cancer institutes and the professional community of oncologists and chemotherapists, launched awareness campaigns and support programs for breast cancer patients.
The program makes use of traditional communication channels as well as social media, conveying high-impact messages like:
“Each day in Russia, 47 children lose their mothers to breast cancer.”
Lessons learned
Access to treatment for women in Russia remains a challenge that needs to be addressed but the social impact of the issue in Russia was one of the first lessons learnt in the program. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2014, 4,154 patients from 84 cities gained access to quality treatment in line with international standards. The program helped to draw attention of the Russian government officials to BC issues in Russia: in 2014, modern treatment for breast cancer was included into federal reimbursement. The program is now terminated.
In total, from 2010 to 2014, as part of the program, 13,032 women from 84 cities received treatment.
The “Giving life a chance” program won external recognition for its contribution to changing the situation for the better. In 2013, the program was ranked among Russia’s Top 20 Best social projects for the second consecutive year.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of 17 diseases that disproportionally impact those living in poverty. More than 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by NTDs, including more than 500 million children. The opportunity exists to help millions of people avoid significant debilitation and disability, including malnutrition, disfigurement and social discrimination. 
The most urgent need in the fight against diseases of the developing world is for new and better medicines. To date, efforts to develop new medicines for treating diseases of the developing world remain somewhat fragmented and disconnected. Despite considerable investment, progress has been limited.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GlaxoSmithKline has an R&D facility in Tres Cantos, Spain, which has been dedicated to developing new treatments to combat diseases of the developing world (DDW) since it was established in 2001. Since that time, GSK has worked in a number of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) that have funded or co-funded a large number of drug discovery projects. In 2010, GSK announced its intention to open up the Tres Cantos facility further, to become a global centre of excellence that brings new partners to the facility and stimulates research and collaboration on neglected diseases where research is still too fragmented.
Established in 2010 as an independent, not-for-profit organisation overseen by a Governing Board, the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation is:
A bold and flexible way to cast the widest possible net in the effort to find new medicines for neglected diseases.
An opportunity for scientists from around the world to partner with GlaxoSmithKline teams, using GSK's facilities and know-how to rapid-test their own projects at the very early stages of drug discovery.
The world's first open laboratory for diseases of the developing world, where world-class scientists can test ideas on an industrial scale.
GSK’s open lab has space for visiting scientists from universities, not-for-profit partnerships and other research institutes - such as the Barcelona Centre for International Health Research (CRESIB), Weill Cornell Medical College in the US, and Imperial College, London - to work on their projects for the developing world, learn from GSK expertise and share its world-class facilities.
A governing board of leading scientists is providing strategic direction for the foundation. All projects must contribute to research that helps discover new medicines for diseases of the developing world.
Open lab projects are designed to explore new ideas that may lead to finding new medicines for diseases of the developing world. Projects are focused on early stage drug discovery and could involve research into new targets, tools, screening, lead identification and optimisation. To be considered for support, there should be added value for the project in operating within the collaborative principles of the Open Lab, and it must align with the strategic objectives of the Foundation:
To develop novel classes of medicines for malaria.
To develop new medicines that reduce treatment time and improve activity against multiple drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB.
To develop novel approaches to tackle other neglected diseases of the developing world, such as leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis.
Early-stage drug discovery and tools for shigellosis research
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To facilitate the establishment of the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation, GSK provided £5 million of an initial investment to support the Foundation’s objectives. In October 2012, two years after the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation was first established, GSK announced that it would double its funding by making an additional £5m available thus reinforcing its commitment to the value of openness and collaboration. TCOLF has also recevied funding from the European Union to co-fund 11 fellowships through the FP7 Cofund programme.

The largest of Novartis’ Oncology Access programs – the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) is a direct-to-patient access program – developed to ensure patients with CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) or GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumour), two rare cancers, receive treatment.
GIPAP’s aim is to provide breakthrough drug, Glivec, at no cost to patients with certain forms of CML and GIST, who would not otherwise have access to treatment. GIPAP also provides patients with access to support groups, treatment and disease information, education and emotional support to help manage their illness. More than 60,000 patients from 80 countries have benefi­tted from GIPAP to date, the program is viewed as one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching cancer access programs ever developed on a global scale.
Novartis partners with physicians and international health organizations to facilitate access to Glivec via GIPAP. To reach as many CML and GIST patients in need as possible in low and middle income countries, GIPAP partners have established clear roles for the partners and a clear process for the program, engaged local governments and officials, and educated local partners to gain their support and commitment. The roles of the key partners are:
The Max Foundation:
Manages a system that enables GIPAP physicians to submit patient cases for approval and re-approval
Assesses submissions to approve patients according to program requirements
Assesses the number of patients in need so Novartis can ship the correct quantity of drugs
Provides emotional support to patients and families involved in GIPAP through local Max station representatives
Axios International:
Supports interaction with GIPAP physicians and institutions in countries where Novartis does not have a presence
Manages the drug import process in countries supported by GIPAP
Interacts with GIPAP institutions on a regular basis to ensure that they follow correct procedure
 Novartis:
Ensures the timely shipment and distribution of the drug
Provides training, support and education to the parties involved
Manages a tracking process to guarantee the correct use of the donations          
Early engagement with governments in GIPAP countries is essential and clear program criteria are vital to the success of a program of this size and ambition. Equally important is clarity on the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved along with standard operating procedures to standardize processes across many disparate countries. Education on the program for physicians, governments, patients, distributors and others involved is also crucial.
The impact of GIPAP is especially significant where local health authorities and civil organizations work together to improve facilities and educate patients and their families, thereby providing resources to offer integrated patient care. The partnership is active in over 80 low and middle income counties.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
TB is second only to HIV as the leading infectious killer of adults worldwide. It is among the three greatest causes of death of women aged 15-44 and is the leading infectious cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS.
Active TB attacks the respiratory system and other organs, destroying body tissue. The disease is contagious, spreading through the air by coughing, sneezing, or even talking. An estimated nine million new active cases develop each year. At any given moment, more than 12 million people around the world are suffering from an active infection.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance), established in 2000, brings together industry, NGOs, governments, foundations and more than 30 partners around the world to accelerate the discovery and development of cost-effective new medicines. The TB Alliance draws on the best practices and resources of the public and private sectors to accelerate the discovery and development of cost-effective new anti-TB medicines, which should shorten or simplify treatment, provide a more effective treatment of multidrug-resistant TB and improve treatment of latent TB infection.
The founders of the TB Alliance are the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Irish Aid, the Netherlands' Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the UK Department of International Development (DFID). Company partners include AstraZeneca, Bayer HealthCare, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.
The partnership functions as a virtual R&D organization. By outsourcing medicine research and development projects, medicine compounds are moved along the development line to achieve regulatory approval and bring them to market at affordable prices for those countries experiencing the highest burden from TB. TB Alliance activities in low and middle income countries include clinical trials in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia and non-clinical or preclinical work in China and India.
The current six-month standard treatment period for TB is based on four medicines that were discovered over 40 years ago. Medicines must be taken for 6 to 8 months, frequently under the direct supervision of healthcare professionals as Directly Observed Therapy– short course (DOTS). A reduced TB treatment regimen should help improve patient compliance, reduce treatment failure rates and decrease the TB-related health costs in endemic disease countries.
Pre-clinical studies have shown that moxifloxacin can reduce the treatment period by two months, if it is administered in place of Isoniazid – one of the pillars of current TB treatment. The results of clinical phase-II studies support the treatment reduction potential of moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin is currently approved in 123 countries for the treatment of acute bacterial infections but is currently not approved for the treatment of TB, including multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB).
Moxifloxacin is currently being assessed in a large, phase-III study (REMoxTB) which may result in the registration of the first new drug approved for the treatment of drug-sensitive TB in nearly 50 years. In all studies, Bayer has made the antibiotic moxifloxacin available free of charge and in cases of positive results will also bear the costs for the approval procedures. To learn more about these trails, click here.
If the data from the clinical trial is positive, TB Alliance and Bayer Healthcare will seek registration of moxifloxacin as part of a multi-drug regimen for drug-sensitive TB and work to make it widely adopted into existing TB treatment programs, and available and affordable to patients who most need it.
Forging global partnerships, the TB Alliance has partnered with some of the world's leading drug developers to jointly manage TB drug discovery portfolios consisting of multiple TB drug discovery programs. This approach aligns target product profiles, makes efficient use of resources, and leverages the expertise and contributions of each partner to have a significant impact on the global discovery portfolio. The TB Alliance jointly manages TB drug discovery portfolios with AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline.
In March 2005, GlaxoSmithKline and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) announced a joint discovery partnership to improve the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  The TB Alliance supports 15 full-time scientists working exclusively on the TB drug program at the GSK R&D facility in Tres Cantos, Spain. To learn more about this discovery partnership, click here.
In August 2014 Novartis has signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) for compounds to fight tuberculosis (TB) that have been discovered at the Novartis Institutes for Tropical Diseases (NITD).
Lessons learned              
The cooperation model of a multi-partnership consortium should be regarded as a new “blueprint” for developing novel treatments for patients in underdeveloped countries suffering from neglected diseases.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Provided that results of the REMoxTB study will be positive, the new indication for a Moxifloxacin containing combination regimen for treatment of pulmonary TB with a shorter duration is planned to be submitted to regulatory authorities in 2014. As part of discovering new drugs,1.5 million compounds have been tested for anti-TB activity and any medicines discovered will be made as affordable and accessible as possible to those most in need.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Lymphatic filariasis (LF), or elephantiasis as it is commonly known, is a mosquito-spread infectious disease that affects 120 million people in more than 50 countries worldwide. Another 947 million people are at risk of infection.
Found in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of Africa, Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East and the Americas, LF is one of the world’s leading causes of disability. It is characterised by severe swelling of the legs and arms and skin infections, and many people affected are unable to work and therefore forced into a life of poverty.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) was created to eliminate one of the world's leading causes of disability and disfigurement as a public health problem by the year 2020. An estimated 120 million people suffer from the disease, and nearly one billion are at risk of infection. The project involves National Ministries of Health of the endemic countries.
Initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and GlaxoSmithKline in 1998, the Global Alliance has evolved into a global partnership between international organizations in the public and private sectors, academia and non-governmental organizations working in partnership with ministries of health in tropical countries where lymphatic filariasis (LF) is endemic. MSD joined the elimination effort in 1998, when it widened the scope of the Mectizan® (ivermectin) Donation Program to include LF in African countries where river blindness and LF co-exist.
The WHO recommends that lymphatic filariasis be prevented with a combination of albendazole (donated by GSK) with either DEC or Mectizan® (donated by MSD). Mass drug administration for people living in endemic areas is recommended by WHO once a year for at least five years to break the cycle of transmission.
In order to ensure that LF elimination programs use resources effectively, the Global Program places great emphasis on integration with other public health programs. Linkages are pursued with programs that use similar strategies – such as bed nets for malaria control, and drugs for controlling intestinal parasites, schistosomiasis and river blindness.
Additionally, Non-Governmental Development Organizations complement the efforts of the national Ministries of Health in implementing different components of the programs within their specific competence and scope.
Lessons learned
Partnership:  Partnership is essential for implementation, resource mobilization, planning, education, patient care and community mobilization
Mutual benefit:  The most sustainable programs are those where there is mutual benefit for both donor and recipient
Core skills:  Companies should use their core skills and strengths to play an active role in partnerships from core products and services through to management expertise for strategic planning, logistics and communications
Measurement:  It is important to collect baseline data and measuring impact year on year
Efficiencies:  Tackling issues in an integrated way opens up new efficiencies and broadens the reach of other programs
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Mass-drug administration with albendazole plus either DEC or MECTIZAN has been initiated in at least 66 countries. Because of these treatments, transmission of LF has been halted and 10 countries were acknowledged as achieving elimination of LF as a public health problem. 11 additional countries have successfully implemented recommended strategies, stopped large-scale treatment and are under surveillance to demonstrate that elimination has been achieved. 68 countries have completed mapping of LF endemic areas. The WHO has set the target of eliminating transmission of LF globally by the year 2020.
GSK has donated more than 7 billion tablets of anti-parasitic medicine, albendazole, to help prevent LF transmission in 65 countries and has committed to donating as much albendazole as needed to the WHO each year until LF is eliminated globally. GSK has also provided grants and other support for the Alliance’s fundraising, advocacy, communications and technical assistance efforts.
The 2014 WHO reports that from 2000 to 2016, 6.7 billion preventive treatments were delivered to more than 850 million people.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Globalization and the unprecedented speed of cross-border infection in the 21st century has created the need for a global health strategy. Awareness of common global threats to the health of citizens has increased, and governments understand the need to work together to counteract these threats. Since 2000, the global community has focused on three of the biggest threats to human health – HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. 
Description of the program
The GHIT Fund was established by three key partners: the Government of Japan, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and five Japanese leading pharmaceutical companies: Astellas Pharma, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Shionogi, and Takeda Pharmaceutical. In 2016, there are now 12 full partners.
As the world’s first public-private partnership, GHIT Fund has facilitated research and development for neglected diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and NTDs. As antimicrobial resistance is also now a serious global health threat, GHIT supports 29 AMR related projects. The combination of Japan’s government and its drug industry—the third largest in the world—brings Japan’s technology, innovation and insights to the development of drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for the developing world.
In 2016, GHIT Fund announced it was investing in a vaccine that could block the transmission of two species of malaria and a rapid fire test that can reveal a malaria infection in a matter of minutes.  It is also investing in the development of a new diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB) by Fujifilm Corporation and Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which can diagnose TB in HIV-positive patients.
In 2015 the GHIT Fund, its members Eisai, Shionogi and Takeda Pharmaceutical, along with partners the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and AstraZeneca began a ground-breaking initiative to accelerate and cut the cost of early stage drug discovery for two of the world’s most neglected diseases, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. 
In 2013 Astellas received a $1.86 million grant to develop and register a new pediatric formulation of the gold standard treatment drug praziquantel to combat schistosomiasis.
In June 2013, with support from the GHIT Fund, Takeda began to work with Product Development Partners (PDPs), including MMV, TB Alliance and DNDi, in a program to screen Takeda’s drug compound library for new candidate compounds that might have the potential to be developed into new drugs for the treatment of infections particularly prevalent in developing countries, such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases.
GHIT has provided grants of $5.7 million to six global partnerships developing innovative drugs and vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis and Chagas disease in the first round of request for proposal (RFP) in November, 2013.  Another $12 million grants for TB and NTDs were awarded to four innovative projects in the second round of RFP in March, 2014.

            Description of the health needs
Cancer is one of the most pressing health challenges of our time.
By 2020, the incidence of new cancers is expected to rise by 50 percent to between 15 million cases and 16 million cases annually. Of these, 75 percent will strike in developing countries, those least prepared to respond. Yet, 40 percent of all cancer deaths can be prevented; tobacco use is the largest single preventable cause of cancer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Pfizer is combating the global cancer epidemic by investing in the growth of promising cancer- and tobacco-control organizations around the world and bringing them together to form a global peer network through the Global Health Partnerships program. One of the most powerful elements of this program lies in the unification of 31 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from around the world around a single mission: to accelerate the pace of progress in the fight against cancer. GHP grantees supported cancer and tobacco control in seven programmatic focus areas:
Building the evidence for enhancing care;
Screening to save lives;
Navigating patients through complicated systems of care;
Building awareness about the harm of tobacco use;
Developing tobacco control capacity;
Protecting nonsmokers from secondhand smoke; and
Helping smokers quit.
The Global Health Partnerships program combined the global philanthropic and in-kind resources of the Pfizer Foundation and Pfizer Inc. Together, the Foundation and local Pfizer offices around the world are comitted USD 47 million over four years (2008-2011) in promising cancer- and tobacco-control projects with programmatic grants, targeted technical assistance, and peer learning and networking opportunities.
The Pfizer Foundation supported the GHP in several fundamental ways:
Tailored technical assistance from Johns Hopkins University to support successful program implementation and to build evaluation capacity
Individualized planning sessions
Training workshops
Webinars to build skills
Evaluation tools / manuals
Sponsorship of leading international conferences to gain cutting-edge knowledge and exposure to global experts

Lessons learned
Customized Messaging & Outreach: Necessary in order to go beyond general public awareness, reach underserved communities and to reflect genuine cultural competency.
Identifying a Community “Champion”: To impact systemic challenges such as stigma, a selected cancer advocate, political figure, or private sector leader can raise awareness and sustain the community change beyond the grant period.
Investment in Evaluation: Despite some initial resistance, NGOs noted positive lessons including more effective communications with funders and policy makers and the ability to make more data-driven program decisions.
Aligning Grants with Technical Assistance: The complementary implementation of on-the-ground consulting, evaluation support, and organizational capacity building furthered the impact of grant funding on program outcomes.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
In the United States, 80 percent of children with cancer survive. In sub-Saharan Africa, the overwhelming majority of pediatric patients do not survive. The mortality rate is estimated to be as high as 90 percent, meaning that thousands of children die from cancer across Africa each year. This is in large part due to an inadequate healthcare infrastructure and a significant lack of expert physicians and other healthcare workers trained to treat children with cancer. The most common types of childhood cancers are blood cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma. 
There are only five pediatric oncologists currently in the countries of Botswana, Malawi and Uganda combined, there are simply not enough expert doctors to treat all the children diagnosed with blood disorders and cancer. It is estimated that in these countries there are more than 11,000 new cases annually of pediatric cancer and 40,000 new cases of serious, life-threatening blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and hemophilia. Because of these staggering numbers, more healthcare providers with special expertise are urgently needed. Global HOPE will help build capacity in the region to diagnose and care for children with blood disorders and cancer, offering the potential for transformational change in survivorship for these children.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation is committing $50 million over five years to fund the training of healthcare providers as well as clinical infrastructure and operations. BIPAI will raise an additional $50 million for the initiative.
Global HOPE will partner with local Governments and Ministries of Health to build medical capacity to diagnose and treat pediatric blood disorders and cancer in Botswana, Malawi and Uganda. The initiative will also create significant clinical, educational and research capabilities. Doctors, nurses and ancillary professionals will be recruited from around the world to provide training to local healthcare professionals and to begin treating children with blood disorders and cancer immediately.
Botswana and Uganda will also serve as regional hubs for pediatric hematology-oncology.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
As public-private partnerships, the various governments will each play an important role in developing the pediatric hematology-oncology network, assisting with the training, technical assistance, logistics and resources to support Global HOPE.
The Global HOPE initiative will train an estimated 4,800 healthcare professionals from Botswana, Uganda, Malawi and other African countries, including doctors, nurses, social workers and other health care workers involved in the treatment, care and support continuum of high qualitypediatric hematology-oncology. The program estimates that over 5,000 children will receive care in the first five years.
The Global HOPE initiative will be modeled on the work of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, BIPAI and the Governments of Botswana, Uganda and Malawi, which created the largest pediatric HIV treatment network in the world, leveraging existing experience, infrastructure, and public/private partnerships created through the initiative. Since 2003, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation and BIPAI have trained 52,000 healthcare professionals and currently provide care for nearly 300,000 children with HIV and their families in sub-Saharan Africa, lowering the mortality rate for these children to 1.2 percent.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Interpol estimates that up to 30% of all medicines in developing countries are either illegal, counterfeit or of inferior quality.
Proliferation of counterfeit medicines constitutes a serious health hazard. No country is immune, but the most impacted are developing countries with weak medicines regulatory as well as weak law enforcement authorities and lacking adequate medicines testing capacities. Fake products can hardly be distinguished from genuine products merely by visual inspection. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To prevent counterfeit and substandard anti-infective medicines infiltrating drug supply organizations and priority disease programs in Malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS endemic countries, the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF), a charitable organisation maintained by Merck, set out to develop and supply at low cost the GPHF-Minilab, a mini-laboratory employing a set of chemical and physical tests for rapid drug quality verification and counterfeit medicines detection in low-income settings of developing countries.
GPHF-Minilabs can instantly help boost medicines testing capacities in developing countries. Currently, 85 active ingredients and essential medicines for a plethora of finished drug products can be verified on the spot to see whether they lack the purported drug compound or have considerably low concentrations of active ingredients. Drugs have been selected on the basis of prevailing prescription practices, public health interest and counterfeit case reports. The current short list consists of common antimicrobials, anthelminthics, antiretrovirals, antimalarials, antituberculosis treatments and other drugs, for example cardiovascular and antidiabetic medicines. Minilabs contain a full set of lab ware, reagents and reference standards. A particular challenge is the provision of manuals with simple test protocols in different languages. Tests may even be performed outside a laboratory environment and do not need to be carried out by a fully qualified pharmacist or chemist. Required is simply a person with analytical chemistry understanding such as a medical or pharmaceutical technician. Training is not necessarily required but may refresh laboratory skills and build confidence in assay reading. In 2016, GPHF alone or together with partners offered training courses in Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda and Mozambique. 
Lessons learned                                                     
Rolling out Minilabs on global scale for post-marketing drug quality surveillance requires intensive networking. Cooperation with local health authorities is a prerequisite for success. Minilabs are fit for screening but cannot replace further forensic testing on failed samples identified. Funding agents want to see the establishment of a reliable logistic chain for a sustainable global material supply and knowledge transfer before investing and supporting. So far, major support has come from United Nation family members (UNICEF, UNODC, WHO, RBM), the Global Fund (AMFm), the U.S. (USAID, USP/PQM, MSH/PFSCM) and Great Britain (UKAID, MeTA, PATHS2). Other support has come from Switzerland (SCIH), Germany (BMZ,GIZ, PTB) and some faith-based organisations.
Recently, the GPHF is provided with contact information of the Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI) asking the GPHF users to provide feedback on sample testing. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since its introduction in 1999, more than 800 Minilabs have been supplied at low cost to health facilities in more than 90 countries across all continents. In recent years, joint drug quality monitoring projects in Southeast Asia and Africa triggered the seizure of millions of counterfeit antimalarial pills containing no active ingredients by Interpol, the World Customs Organization and national enforcement bodies. Data generated by the programme have also prompted WHO global drug alerts. Thus, thousands of lives were saved.
The method inventory of the GPHF-Minilab is constantly reviewed and extended to cover more active ingredients and to keep up with new challenges caused by changing therapeutic regimes such as the shift from single to fixed-dose combination antimalarials.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Polio (poliomyelitis) is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. The strategy to eradicate polio is therefore based on preventing infection by immunizing every child until transmission stops and the world is polio-free.
Though this disease has nearly disappeared from the collective consciousness, it continues to trigger epidemic outbreaks in certain countries of sub-Saharan Africa and central/south Asia. Although the number of cases has dropped by over 99% since 1988, polio remains a devastating disease for the people it strikes. Polio is still endemic in three countries (Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan) and the infection has reappeared in several countries. That is how, since 2003, annual case numbers have fluctuated between 1000 and 2000, and between 12 and 23 countries every year have reported polio cases due to imported polioviruses. In light of the current situation, the challenge for Sanofi Pasteur is to continue to play a decisive role in eradicating the disease.
From 2017, if no cases of wild polio are detected for three years, the time the virus can survive outside the body, the world will be officially declared polio free. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, spearheaded by WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF -- with additional support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- has achieved a 99% reduction of the number of polio cases worldwide. Polio is caused by three strains of poliovirus, types 1, 2 and 3. Wild poliovirus type 2 has already been eliminated, and it is hoped that poliovirus type 1 and 3 will be eradicated within a few years, definitively wiping polio from the surface of the earth.
In 2013 Sanofi announced its commitment to provide 1.7 billion doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to support the Global Polio eradication Initiative’s (GPEI) strategy to eradicate polio this decade. The doses of OPV will be delivered through 2017 for GPEI polio vaccination program.
Sanofi Pasteur, as a leader in providing both OPV and IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine), has been a partner of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative for over 20 years. The company has provided more than six billion doses of OPV to UNICEF over last two decades.
When an epidemic broke out in Egypt and at the request of the WHO, the Group developed the first monovalent oral polio vaccine, which contributed to eliminating the disease in this country.  
In 1982, Sanofi Pasteur registered the first enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is now distributed globally as a stand-alone poliovirus vaccine as well as in combination with pediatric vaccines to immunize against many diseases in a single shot. Since then, Sanofi Pasteur has distributed more than 1 billion doses of IPV and IPV-containing vaccines. 
Sanofi Pasteur has made significant investments in modern technology to produce very large quantities of IPV -- up to 300 million doses a year. As well as this substantial investment in production capacity, Sanofi Pasteur support to IPV now includes development of a five-dose vial presentation (as well as the standard ten-dose vial presentation) to reduce wastage, a massive regulatory and licensing program in about 100 countries and expert contributions on scientific, program and technical questions.
In 2015, Sanofi Pasteur and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation began offering a new IPV pricing structure so that 120 new countries can be provided with large quantities of high-quality vaccines at low cost to ensure their rapid and widespread adoption.
Lessons learned              
The eradication of polio needs a global approach. First, it must include all endemic countries but also have an approach of countries with re-established transmission as well as those susceptible to import the disease. In addition of the vaccine supply, a strong political engagement is crucial but also the mobilization of the community and oversight community mobilization.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Huge achievements have been made in the global fight against polio since 1988, when the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate the disease. The number of polio cases worldwide has decreased by more than 99%, from 350 000 in 1988 to just 36 cases in 2016 – a 99.9% decrease in the number of cases worldwide between 1988 and 2016. Over 2.5 billion children have been vaccinated and an estimated 10 million people have been saved from polio-related paralysis.
When the initiative was first launched in in 1988, the virus was endemic in 125 countries. Today. This is only true of two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. The last case of polio in Africa was reported in Somalia in August 2014. Since then, no new cases have been recorded anywhere on the continent, representing a major advance in the eradication of the disease. In September 2015, the WHO announced that Nigeria had been removed from the list of endemic countries.
Sanofi Pasteur will continue to maintain its important historic role and commitment to vaccination. In the future, the Group is convinced that the use of injectable vaccines will increase. Sanofi Pasteur offers an industrial solution that enables mass production of IPV on a global scale. Following the eradication of smallpox, polio is expected to be the second infection to be eradicated worldwide.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
No country stands for economic growth like China. However, this rapid rise means a great challenge for healthcare. In the major cities the rising standard of living is leading to an increase in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases; at the same time there are rural regions, especially in the west of the country, with poorly developed medical infrastructures and low standards of healthcare. Local patients need appropriate medical care matching current standards, which involves requisite knowledge and skills.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In cooperation with China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission, BHC provides professional trainings for local physicians and hospital executives in rural hospitals of China so that the rural population can gain access to highly developed diagnosis techniques and efficient therapies.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since its launch in 2007, the project has been successfully extended to 23 provinces/regions with 143 training courses and provided professional trainings to over 16,000 doctors and hospital executives, by the end of March 2014. An additional $3.09 million (20 million yuan) have been provided for the 2012 to 2017 extension of the program.

Type 1 diabetes is a form of diabetes mellitus that results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. The disease is fatal unless treated with multiple injection of insulin daily such as Basal Bolus or continuous infusion of insulin for the life time. The disease is often diagnosed in individuals of young age, and people with Type 1 diabetes risk suffering from complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, or amputation if the disease is not well controlled.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The study aims to gather data and information on the coverage, cost and care for people with Type 1 diabetes in China. The results will be used to increase the awareness for improving T1D in china and to make a call for action. The ‘3C Study on Type 1 Diabetes in China’ was carried out in Beijing and Shantou, Guangdong Province, at primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare institutions, and the results have been presented at the World Diabetes Congress in December 2011 in Dubai.
Lessons learned               
The conduction of a situation analysis of the disease in those 2 regions in China was a very important steps for the project as it helps to identify the existing gaps.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In September 2013, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) signed a two-year extension, with the possibility of an additional third year, of their current research collaboration agreement to develop new therapeutics for Leishmaniasis, Human African Trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease. Patients urgently need better treatments as the existing ones are not suitable due to the emergence of parasite resistance, their severe side effects and toxicity, costs or non-suitable routes of administration.
Under the terms of the agreement, DNDi and GSK will jointly exploit hits identified through GSK’s internal high throughput screening efforts vs. Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei. DNDi will contribute with up to 12 chemistry FTEs from their own consortia in addition to the 2 matching FTEs at Tres Cantos. The scope of the agreement has been expanded to the identification of preclinical activities and will include testing of identified hit(s) in the corresponding animal models in order to evaluate their in vivo efficacy and further progression of efficacious compounds in Lead Optimization programs.
The partners will facilitate publication of the results to ensure access to the wider community of researchers focusing on NTDs. The public sector will benefit from the drugs developed through this agreement under the best possible conditions to ease access for patients in all endemic countries, irrespective of their level of economic development.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It kills more than 1 million people each year, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is the leading cause of death in children under five.
Because malaria is a global emergency that affects mostly poor women and children, the disease perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty in the developing world. Malaria-related illnesses and mortality cost Africa’s economy alone USD 12 billion per year.
Today, malaria can be prevented, diagnosed and treated with a combination of available tools, but it takes global commitment. Estimates indicate that USD 4.2 billion is needed each year to fund the fight against malaria effectively.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GlaxoSmithKline has created a dedicated R&D group to focus on diseases of the developing world (DDW), specifically malaria and TB, with a DDW drug discovery center at its Tres Cantos R&D site in Spain and clinical development experts in the UK and US. DDW projects are prioritized by their social and public health benefits rather than commercial return.
GSK's malaria lead treatment project is for Tafenoquine, a potential treatment for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria, the most frequent and widely distributed cause of relapsing malaria. This affects millions of people each year mainly in South East Asia and Latin America. Tafenoquine, which is being developed in partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), is planned  to start phase III development in 2014. An initial study to understand tafenoquine and G6PD deficiency (a common gene deficiency in areas where malaria is prevalent and which can affect the choice of malaria treatment) has been completed.
GSK also has a number of other projects for anti-malarials in the lead optimization and target identification and validations stages of the R&D process.
In 2010 GSK published research findings that could help identify potential new treatments for malaria. The research was the result of a year-long screening process in which five GSK scientists reviewed more than two million compounds in GSK’s chemical library to seek out those that could inhibit the malaria parasite. This process identified 13,533 compounds that showed greatest activity. More than 80% of these molecules are proprietary to GSK, and it is the first time they have been made available to the wider research community.
GSK's malaria compound set is part of the ‘malaria box set’ that Medicines for Malaria Venture has been sent to more than 160 groups around the world. GSK aims to identify other datasets and make them publicly available to act as a catalyst to stimulate further research in diseases of the developing world.
By working with PPPs such as MMV, GSK shares the costs and risks of R&D. GSK works closely with MMV, which subsidizes 25 scientists at Tres Cantos. GSK provides the clinical, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to advance compounds in clinical development.

TB is second only to HIV as the leading infectious killer of adults worldwide. It is among the three greatest causes of death of women aged 15-44 and is the leading infectious cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS.
Active TB attacks the respiratory system and other organs, destroying body tissue. The disease is contagious, spreading through the air by coughing, sneezing, or even talking. An estimated nine million new active cases develop each year. At any given moment, more than 12 million people around the world are suffering from an active TB infection.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In March 2005, GlaxoSmithKline and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) announced a joint discovery partnership to improve the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). The TB Alliance supports 15 full-time scientists working exclusively on the TB drug program at the GSK R&D facility in Tres Cantos, Spain. GSK contributes at least a matching number of staff and all remaining overhead costs.  To achieve global control of this epidemic, there is an urgent need for new TB drugs, which can: (1) shorten treatment duration; (2) target MDR or XDR strains; (3) simplify treatment by reducing the daily pill burden; (4) lower dosing frequency (for example, a once-weekly regimen); and (5) be co-administered with HIV medications.
Around 2 million compounds have been tested for anti-TB activity and any medicines discovered will be made as affordable and accessible as possible to those most in need. A strategic combination of single-enzyme targets and phenotypic screen hits is expected to be a successful strategy and the program broadens the worldwide TB medicine pipeline by adding several novel classes of compounds with new mechanisms of action. Drug candidates arising from these projects could treat patients who are resistant to conventional therapies.
The joint research program consists of a mini-portfolio projects intended to yield new compounds that attack Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) on multiple levels. The mini-portfolio currently includes 5 novel chemical series initially identified in phenotypic screens (extracellular M.tb or M.tb infecting monocytes). The successful elucidation of its mechanism of action has delivered new enzyme targets which are now being screened against GSK corporate compound collection. Special attention is dedicated to the discovery of compounds active against M.tb which are not effectively cleared by current anti-TB drugs. A shorter TB regimen is expected to improve patient compliance, increase cure rates and lower toxic side effects, thereby limiting the rise of new resistant strains. A novel TB regimen that is compatible with HIV treatments would improve TB control and help in the fight against AIDS. In 2012, GSK and TB Alliance agreed a 3-year extension of the program.

Effective methods of treating and preventing HIV with antiretroviral drugs are available today. However, they currently require that people take medication every day, which is challenging for many individuals. People living with HIV need additional treatment options. By working to develop preventive and therapeutic medicines that can be taken much less often, this partnership aims to create viable alternatives for people who are at substantial risk for HIV infection or for infected individuals for whom adherence is an impediment to effective treatment. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Established between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the partnership specifically enables researchers to develop one or more broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which can stop a wide range of HIV strains from infecting human cells in the laboratory, into a product to treat or prevent HIV infection.
Research and development will be conducted by NIAID’s Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center (VRC) scientists under a five-year cooperative research and development agreement with GSK. This will combine the scientists expertise in discovering and analyzing HIV bNAbs with the company’s pharmaceutical development capability and experience in long-acting antiretroviral therapies.
The program will be aimed to evaluate and work to improve known and novel HIV bNAbs, and identify combinations of bNAbs capable of blocking the widest range of HIV strains. The joint team will evaluate bNAbs discovered at NIAID to determine which ones are the most promising for further development. Ultimately, the research team expects to combine two complementary antibodies, each targeting different sites on the HIV surface molecule that attaches to human cells. Virus strains that are resistant to one bNAb likely would be vulnerable to the other, increasing the likelihood that at least one of the two antibodies neutralizes the virus.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
GSK recognises the potential for promotional sales and marketing activity to contribute to inappropriate use of antibiotics. We are committed to ensuring that our sales representatives put patient needs first and therefore we do not incentivise volume sales of antibiotics but instead encourage appropriate use. We have also changed common marketing practices to avoid the risk of undue influence over prescribing.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Traditional sales and marketing activities are designed to increase sales of the company’s products. GSK recognised the potential for this to contribute to inappropriate use of medicines; particularly concerning with antibiotics, due to the need for conservation.
Under GSK’s new model, sales representatives  are incentivised based on their technical knowledge, the quality of service they deliver to healthcare professionals to support improved patient care, and a broader set of business performance measures. The majority of GSK's representatives include appropriate use in every discussion with healthcare professionals and during 2017 GSK will extend this emphasis globally.
As of January 2016, we no longer pay healthcare professionals to speak about our prescription medicines and vaccines. We will continue to pay healthcare professionals for providing services and for participating in our clinical research; these payments are governed by rigorous controls and are based on fair market value.
GSK is also changing the way it supports medical education by no longer choosing which healthcare professionals we sponsor to attend scientific congresses. Instead, we will provide funding to independent professional bodies who will allocate funding to individuals – another industry first.
GSK sales and marketing employees, along with relevant third parties, must follow a Code of Practice for Promotion and Customer Interactions.

Access to quality healthcare in underserved communities remains a key challenge globally. GSK programs with Save the Children aim to improve access to quality healthcare for the most underserved, whilst building a long-term, sustainable solution through educating communities on preventative health and accessing the health system, capacity building and advocacy.

            

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Specific areas of focus for our partnership are: improving access to basic healthcare – prevention and treatment – where the need is greatest; training and equipping health workers in the poorest communities; developing child friendly medicines with the potential to help save more lives; and working together and local and global levels to call for stronger child health policies and capacity building.  To date the partnership has reached over 4.6m people, including 2.6m children.  This global partnership has also created a step change in the speed at which GSK responds and help Save the Children’s emergency response to humanitarian crises and disaster relief.   This includes establishing an Emergency Health Unit to ensure a team of specialist health workers can be on the ground delivering basic healthcare within 72 hours as well as supporting Save the Children’s work for refugees in transit countries.
The partnership supports two flagship programs, one in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the other in Kenya, to tackle severe challenges in the supply of, and demand for, effective healthcare for mothers and babies.  Through these programs we aim to generate evidence and learning that can be replicated at scale.  These programs were created in conjunction with the respective Ministries of Health to help increase the likelihood that the model will continue locally and be scaled up nationally.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Despite substantial economic growth in Africa over the last few decades, access to affordable healthcare remains one of the greatest challenges to sustained economic development. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 11% of the world’s population, yet bears 24% of the global disease burden and commands less than 1% of global health expenditure. It also faces a severe shortage of trained medical personnel, with just 3% of the world’s health workers deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership shared vision is that in the future, economically sustainable and resilient health systems will be able to deliver affordable and accessible quality healthcare across Africa, while increasing access to financial products, supporting small business development and creating jobs.
To help achieve this, the partnership has implemented an initial pilot in Zambia to explore and address the economic and financial barriers that currently exist in health systems across Africa. By the end of 2016 Barclays and GSK will have together invested up to £7m in financial support and on the ground resource over a 3 year period, with the ambitious goal of reaching 1 million out of the total population of 14 million people living in Zambia. 
The partnership has been designed to align with the Zambian government’s National Health plans. Hon Joseph Kasonde, Minister of Health, Zambia has said: “We are very pleased to support the Barclays GSK Program which aligns well with priorities in the Zambian National Health Strategic Plan.” The partnership was also recognized by the Clinton Global Initiatives as a 2013 Commitment to Action. 
In Zambia, the partnership has set up the social enterprise, Live Well, in collaboration with CARE which tests a new route to market for GSK. Live Well recruits, trains and supports a network of Community Health Entrepreneurs (CHEs) in peri-urban and rural areas to promote healthcare and sell health impact products into underserved communities. Since the beginning of this project, over 300 CHEs have been recruited and 15,000 GSK products sold, which accounts for over 50% of total Live Well sales. It is anticipated that as the program grows across the country and to other countries GSK will reach a significant return on investment through expanded reach and increased volumes of sales.
At each step, GSK is working closely with other organisations such as government, NGOs and civil society as they develop thinking and plans. GSK hopes that ultimately, by working together, they can help unblock financial barriers and enhance government efforts to help increase access to affordable healthcare, ensuring the project is locally owned and self-sustaining.

            Partnership objectives 
Saving women’s lives through scaling-up cervical cancer prevention in least developed countries through promoting 5 key objectives:
Advocacy: To support the development and/or implementation of national strategies for cervical prevention and control in the three proposed countries.  
Awareness: To increase awareness among clients and service providers of the impact of cervical cancer and the availability of preventative services in the three countries.
Screening and prevention: To introduce and/or enhance cervical cancer screening and preventative therapy services in the three proposed countries. 
Organisational development: To strengthen MSI service providers’ knowledge & skills in cervical cancer prevention and treatment in the three countries. 
Vaccination: To deliver HPV vaccination to girls (ages 9–13) in Bangladesh. As part of MSI’s wider cancer prevention advocacy efforts, MSI would seek to support GAVI demonstration vaccination pilot Sierra Leone and national scale up in Madagascar.


            

            

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women worldwide with 500,000 new cases and 250,000 deaths each year. The devastating impact of cervical cancer is disproportionately felt in developing countries where 80% of cases occur. 
Cervical cancer is both preventable and curable, with the HPV vaccine proving over 99% effective and forming the primary strategy for preventing cervical cancer. However, the lack of access to this vaccination and screening services in under-resourced developing countries makes women particularly vulnerable to Cervical cancer. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
The GSK-MSI partnership contributes to national efforts to reduce mortality through prevention and control of cervical cancer by advancing country level objectives in three of the world’s least developed countries; Bangladesh, Madagascar and Sierra Leone. 
The project in Bangladesh will provide 10,625 Cervical cancer screening services and 9,000 HPV vaccinations over 3 years, whilst creating a model for the future scale up of comprehensive cervical cancer prevention programmes and to facilitate policy dialogue at the national level. Similarly, in Madagascar, the partnership will promote awareness and work on advocacy whilst providing 34,000 Cervical cancer screening services and cryotherapy to 1,564 women. Finally, in Sierra Leone, screening services will be provided to 4,800 women during the 3 year project. These projects will follow WHO best practice on Cervical cancer prevention and take into account recommendations by GAVI. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
So far, a total of 5,647 women have been screened through the project, leading to 215 women receiving cryotherapy. 
The Partnership works alongside local and national health authorities to provide high quality services with a view to sustainability. Behaviour change communications will strengthen knowledge around Cervical cancer prevention and increase demand for services. Meanwhile, the capacity building of health providers will ensure the continued supply of screening and preventative therapy.

            Partnership objectives
Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) is a leading public-private partnership aimed at catalysing the global community to reduce deaths from cervical and breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa by raising awareness of these diseases and increasing access to quality services to detect and treat them. 
The overarching targets of the partnership are; firstly, to launch an HPV vaccination demonstration programme and achieve at least 80% coverage of girls within the target population. Secondly, the partnership aims to reach at least 80% coverage of screening and treatment for pre-invasive cervical cancer within the appropriate target populations of women. 

                        

            

            

            What are the health needs and challenges?
There are approximately 19 million women aged 15-44 in Ethiopia. Within this group, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) estimates that there are at least 6,648 new cases of cervical cancer and 3,235 deaths each year resulting from cervical cancer, which ranks as the second-most frequent cancer among women aged 15-44 in the country.
Therefore, in line with the national government’s commitment to address cancer as a key area of focus, Ethiopia has been identified as a key country for PRRR to support, to aid the development of a strategic plan to control the disease. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
PRRR provides policy support and raises awareness to encourage capacity building and to increase access to services across the continuum of care in Ethiopia. Through the provision of HPV vaccinations, cervical cancer screening and cryotherapy, PRRR is helping to reduce morbidity and mortality from cervical and breast cancer. PRRR also assists in the development of a National Cancer Control Strategy to regionalise cancer treatment. In addition, the partnership performs monitoring and evaluation activities to measure the results of the cervical cancer strategy.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
During 2016, 8,931 women have received screening for cervical cancer, of which, 850 women were VIA positive. This led to the treatment of 779 women with cryotherapy. In addition, PRRR aimed to provide HPV vaccinations for 5,773 women.
In 2017, PRRR will continue to provide training to health workers and supply facilities across Ethiopia to conduct mass screening campaigns and mobile outreaches. It is expected that 11,547 women will receive a HPV vaccination and 24,600 women will be screened for cervical cancer. 
Measurement of progress towards objectives 
Estimated overall value of partnership:
 PRRR raised a total of US$7.8 million in contributions, both in cash and in kind, for its programme in Ethiopia, including US$2 million over three years, committed by GSK.
Estimated amount of people impacted:
PRRR aims to provide HPV vaccinations to 11,547 women aged 15-44 and provide cervical cancer screenings to 24,600 women. Of this target group, it is expected that around 1,230 - 2,460 women will be VIA positive, leading to the treatment of 984 -1,968 women with cryotherapy.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
It has been a long standing challenge to help low-and-middle income countries battle diseases, and while examples of progress have been made, including the eradication of smallpox, and the near eradication of polio, developing nations are still disproportionately burdened by infectious diseases that devastate lives and livelihoods, and put a continuous drag on struggling economies.
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death owing to an infectious disease, claiming around 1.5 million lives each year. Standard TB treatment requires six months combination therapy and, for drug-resistant TB, this extends to 18 to 24 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a shorter, better tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of drug-sensitive TB, as well as a combination therapy that will be more effective in the treatment of drug-resistant TB.
South Africa carries a massive TB burden, and this is exacerbated by co-morbidities including HIV and diabetes. In addition, the country is among the top four globally with the highest prevalence of drug-resistant TB disease (TB-in-South Africa).
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
H3-D is the first drug discovery centre in Africa, with an initial research focus on TB and malaria, two top medical needs on the continent. Last year, the first compound developed by H3-D was endorsed by the Medicines for Malaria Venture as a pre-clinical anti-malarial candidate.
Through this partnership, Novartis supports the Centre’s efforts to bridge the gap between basic and clinical studies, training a new generation of African scientists with key skills required for drug discovery and development – integrating medicinal chemistry, disease biology, and pharmacology.
For example, through this collaboration Novartis helped H3-D to develop an FDA-­level clinical site to conduct Phase I clinical studies of new medicines discovered by the Centre in Cape Town, South Africa. Additionally, Novartis supports H3-­D in the design of medicines against tuberculosis (TB), and conduct joint programs on malaria research with the Singapore-­based Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD).As part of the NITD-H3D collaboration, NITD transferred its early TB research projects to H3D (including assays, early discovery compounds, etc.) along with expertise and knowledge (through a comprehensive workshop with NITD scientists at H3D).
In a major development in 2013, H3D was awarded funding by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) for malaria and TB drug discovery and, subsequently, was elected to the Tuberculosis Drug Accelerator (TBDA). Within the context of the TBDA, further collaborations were initiated with the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) and Elli Lilly, as well as Celgene Global Health. H3D also partners with the HIT-TB consortium, taking advantage of powerful collaborations with NIH research groupings as well as leading public and private institutions in exploring advanced research models to identify new medicines to treat TB.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The current partnership portfolio comprises several programs with new chemical series ready to be tested on animals.  In addition, multiple chemical series identified from whole-cell screens of pharmaceutical libraries such as Celgene’s are being evaluated in order to deliver pre-clinical treatments that can be effective against TB in humans.

Estimates developed by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and The World Bank. World Health Organization) Approximately 50% of global maternal deaths occur annually in sub-Saharan Africa, as do deaths among children under five. It is estimated that 80% of maternal deaths could be prevented by timely health care before, during and after birth. (Source: White Ribbon Alliance, Global Maternal Mortality Fact Sheet).

In order to better meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly MDGs #4 (reduce the under-5 mortality rate) and #5 (reduce maternal mortality), the UN Secretary General encouraged UN agencies to embark on Joint Programs. The aim of this coalition was to aid in decreasing maternal and newborn mortality in 60 of the world’s most disadvantaged countries. The organizations involved in the Health 4+ partnership include: UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, UNWomen and UNAIDS. Health 4+ believes the most effective way to help realize the MDGs is to build upon existing programs within target countries, by improving coordination, and leveraging the collective strengths of each member agency.
Johnson & Johnson’s partnership with Health4+ focuses on Ethiopia and Tanzania, including Zanzibar. In Tanzania, 1 in 23 women run a lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy and childbirth and Ethiopia has the 5th highest maternal mortality rate in the world with a 1 in 27 lifetime risk. Even though Ethiopia and Tanzania have each made significant strides recently in reducing infant mortality, the mortality rate is still especially high. This program aims to help reducing maternal and infant mortality in the two countries by building the capacity of birth attendants to manage emergency obstetric and neonatal care. The partnership is training Integrated Emergency Obstetric Surgeons, nurses and midwives. Johnson & Johnson was the first private sector organization to support this effort.
By the end of the four-year project, this program expects to increase the number of facility-based infant deliveries, decrease maternal mortality, decrease infant mortality, and provide a sustainable infrastructure for improved MNH services. At the project’s conclusion we aim to have directly impacted 1.3 million lives, while a further 3 million lives will have been indirectly impacted across the two countries.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
Two skills labs were renovated at the Midwifery Schools at the College of Health and Sciences in Zanzibar, Tanzania.

As many as 70% of Kenyans do not know their HIV status. Research performed in both Africa and the U.S. shows that awareness of HIV status greatly reduces risk behaviors. Testing people before they are obviously ill and before they have infected their partners will prevent thousands of individuals from becoming HIV-positive in the first place.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Health at Home/Kenya is an initiative coordinated by Global Business Coalition (GBC) that is providing home-based HIV/AIDS testing for children into the homes of millions of Kenyans in a remote region with difficult access to health care. In addition to testing for HIV, they also screen for tuberculosis and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, treat children for intestinal worms, deliver treated bed nets to prevent malaria, and provide nutritional counseling. Household Counselling and Testing (HCT) workers enroll every individual in each community and register them in AMPATH medical database. Enrollment into the program consists of gathering information on each person in every household, including health and demographic details and GPS location information, and assigning each individual a unique identifier. 
On-the-ground implementation of Health at Home Kenya is being managed by the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), based in Eldoret, Kenya, working closely with the Kenyan government and PEPFAR.
This two-year initiative is supported by PEPFAR and GBC member companies. The initiative is being brought to scale by industry competitors working side-by-side in common cause - serving as a model to be replicated in other AIDS endemic regions of the world.
To date, 99% of households in communities reached by the Health at Home/Kenya Impact Initiative have welcomed HIV counselors inside their homes and 97% have agreed to be tested. More than 9,200 people have been found to be HIV positive and directly connected to treatment programs on the spot. Among pregnant women who test HIV positive, 77% were newly identified, and are now in PMTCT (prevention of maternal to child transmission) services and able to prevent transmission to their unborn babies.
Initially focused on HIV/AIDS testing and treatment, AMPATH soon recognized the urgent need for comprehensive responses to chronic health problems in Africa. Today the group uses its learnings in ongoing programs that provide sustainable support for Kenyans with diabetes and other conditions that require ongoing management, care and support.

Due to the lack of a universal social protection system, the association Inter Aide has introduced an innovative model of social protection for the poorest families living in certain districts of Pune and Mumbai called the Health Mutual Fund. When micro-credit becomes available, families consistently tend to join to a mutual health insurance scheme for a fee of 100 INR (€1.7 per person).
This entitles them to:
A refund for hospitalization worth up to 15,000 INR (about €260).
Access to contracted healthcare providers where rates are negotiated on average 30% below standard market prices.

The Takeda-Plan Healthcare Access Program was established in 2009 in collaboration with Plan Japan. The program supports detailed initiatives to improve access to healthcare services for children in four Asian countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Takeda representative visited all program sites in the all countries and engaged in dialogue with several stakeholders to find ways to improve the program. The four individual projects that are being implemented based on the Takeda-Plan program conform to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were adopted in 2000.
Activities in Thailand: A major health issue in Thailand is that most new cases of HIV infection are among young people. The project conducts health education activities at 17 schools (public and private) to try to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
Activities in the Philippines: Targeting regions lacking healthcare support infrastructure, the project provides monetary support for hospitalization, treatment and the purchase of medications and also provides medical equipment.
Activities in China: Malnutrition is widespread in children in certain rural parts of China. The project includes nutrition education activities in four schools (with 5,900 students in total) and distributes free food supplies.
Activities in Indonesia: Many children in Indonesia die from diarrhea-type diseases. The program targets five villages each year promoting activities aimed at eliminating the unhygienic habit of defecation outdoors.
Lessons learned
Improving and maintaining the health of children in coutnries countries requires measures that match the differing needs of each region.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
This program achieved steady progress with expansion of geographical coverage and an increase in the total number of children who gained access to healthcare.
Thailand: Comprehensive sexuality education has been provided to a total of 8,420 people at 16 schools, including students, teachers, and guardians, as part of the regular curriculum or extra-curricular programs. A student representative group was formed to increase awareness of comprehensive sexuality education within school (80 individuals at 1 school). Through regional awareness-raising activities, knowledge was disseminated to people other than just students and school personnel
Philippines: The initiative conducted consultations, treatment, hospitalization, and surgery (78 individuals) and supplied assistive medical equipment  to 28 individuals. Village councils approved financial support for part of the transportation expenses of children from villages to hospitals, as well as part of the transportation expenses for the children’s parents and relatives.
China: Takeda and Plan Japan supplied nutrition booklets for students and instructors (12,300 copies), food materials (for a total of about 5,900 students at 4 schools) and conducted awareness-raising activities through essay writing contests led by a Children’s Committee (for 3,400 individuals at 3 schools). About 65% of all the children said that they have started to give more thought to nutrition when choosing snacks.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Opened in 2005, the Boehringer Ingelheim Training and Facilitation Unit in Gaborone, Botswana trains general practitioners, physicians, occupational health specialists, nurses, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, medical store managers, healthcare managers and health ministry officials. Since its foundation in 2005, some 7,100 attendees have taken part in training activities at the unit. Working with partners such as Harvard University, the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and the WHO, it provides continuing medical education workshops, courses and lectures on the management of acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and HIV/AIDS, along with Good Clinical Practice, leadership training, customer relations, pediatric care, biopharmaceuticals and pharmacovigilance,. It also undertakes public health awareness and education programs (see separate program entry in Chronic Disease section), and hosts meetings of the Botswana Medical Society, the HIV Clinician Society, the Pharmaceutical Society of Botswana and other associations.
The Boehringer Ingelheim Endowed Chair in Clinical Pharmacology was set up in 2009 and helps to raise the status of health professionals and facilitates the provision of vital training to young interns and doctors, helping to advance the fight against HIV/AIDS in Botswana. It helps to lay the foundations for the Botswana Medical School, opened in 2013.
In 2006, the first pharmacy student from Botswana started at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa under a Botswana government program funded by Boehringer Ingelheim. Beneficiaries are required to work in the public sector after completing their studies.
Boehringer Ingelheim South Africa established a partnership with the Government of Botswana to build an infectious disease care clinic (IDCC) at Gumare, a small rural village on the outskirts of the Okavango Delta in Botswana. The clinic, officially opened in 2007, serves the community for general healthcare requirements and the Anti-retroviral (ARV) Clinic Sponsorship helps to overcome the ARV treatment bottlenecks in this area.
HIV/AIDS has a major impact on health in Botswana and Boehringer Ingelheim currently runs two clinical trials there for its nevirapine ARV. A new extended release mechanism for this ARV is being evaluated which will hopefully benefit women suffering from HIV/AIDS in Botswana. The first HIV study was initiated in 2008. Boehringer Ingelheim’s ongoing clinical trial work in Botswana also addresses hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the country. Boehringer Ingelheim was the first company to identify and train private practitioners to conduct clinical trials in Botswana, while at the same time bringing important research work to the Princess Marina Hospital and other medical centers.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In natural disasters or conflicts, health needs pose vital problems and require emergency and post-emergency solutions. To rescue injured, homeless or displaced victims, the Sanofi Espoir Foundation works with NGOs in the field.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2013, the Foundation and its Sanofi affiliates provided emergency aid to nine countries. They include those affected by the crisis in Syria (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq), in China, and in the countries of the Indian Ocean (Comoros, Mozambique and Seychelles) along with donations of medicines and vaccines for 14 countries aiding a total of 2.85 million beneficiaries.
Aiding the civil war-torn population in Bangui
In the Central African Republic, the violence fueled by the political crisis plunged the city into a serious crisis, forcing its inhabitants to flee from physical mistreatment. To respond to health emergencies, the Foundation is currently supporting via the Fund Ready a medical program to provide primary health care to 9,000 residents in three Bangui neighborhoods. Emergency kits were also supplied via the Tulipe association to which the Foundation provided financial support and donations of medicines.
Philippines Solidarity
Typhoon Hayian hit 16 million people in November 2013, causing 6,000 deaths and destroying one million homes. Immediate support from the Sanofi Espoir Foundation and the generosity of Sanofi employees provided emergency and post-emergency assistance to the victims of one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history. This included: establishing mobile clinics, providing medical tents and health kits offering essential care for the wounded.
With Médecins du Monde, activities focused on the island of Leyte to rehabilitate 12 health centers in four districts for about 185,000 people in cooperation with local authorities.
With the French Red Cross, which sent its field teams to the north of the island of Cebu, Sanofi shared in efforts coordinated by the French embassy and helped build health centers.
Humanitarian emergency in South Sudan
Sanofi Espoir Foundation is supporting the AMREF intervention plan to help reduce mortality and morbidity due to sudden injuries resulting from the conflict and to improve the quality of life of survivors. The program aims to step up access to emergency care and surgical services for the war-wounded and displaced persons. This response plan will aid 500 wounded by the end of August 2014 through surgery, emergency care and building capacities to receive and care for patients at these four hospitals.

            Partnership objectives
Improve health outcomes by supporting frontline health workers who operate in least developed countries (LDC) and reinvesting 20% of profits made in LDCs back into their country’s healthcare infrastructure.
Address the estimated shortfall of at least 7.2 million health workers needed globally in order to provide lifesaving healthcare for mothers and children.

					
						The partnership aims to galvanize support to encourage both local and international organizations to make similar commitments in LDCs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The chronic shortage of trained frontline health workers in LDCs is recognized as one of the most fundamental constraints to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and providing millions of people with the treatment they need. Appropriately trained and adequately supported frontline health workers can improve access to basic health services in their communities, leading to improved health outcomes, especially for mothers and children.
For example, in some settings, a fully trained and well-supported community health worker can effectively deliver treatments, and provide health education for common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria and acute malnutrition and reach up to 5,000 children in a year.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
By investing in training for frontline health workers, we are helping ensure the sustainability of our access programs. Since 2009, we have reinvested 20% of profits generated from medicines sold in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), back into those countries’ healthcare systems, partnering with three different NGOs – Amref Health Africa, Save the Children, and CARE International. Following the launch of the ‘Investing in Africa and Developing Countries’ strategy, the frontline healthworker program has been expanded to cover all non-LDCs in Africa, starting with Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. The HCW program has delivered significant and measurable impact including reducing mortality rates in Nepal and catalysing investment in the health workforce in Ghana. Through Global Community Partnerships we provide money, medicines, time and equipment to bring sustainable improvements in the health and education of our communities.
All programs are to be agreed with country ministries of health and in alignment with their health priorities. Each agency is responsible for establishing a regional Health Infrastructure Partnerships (HIP), including representatives from groups such as local healthcare organizations, government officials and the WHO, through which the funding will be channeled and projects selected.
The project aims:
To be sustainable: Reinvesting a proportion of profits made in the LDCs provides a sustainable model to grow GSK's business and gives communities the assurance of a long-term funding commitment, not just for one year, but for years to come.
To be scalable: The projects can be scaled up according to the level of investment available.
To address clear healthcare needs in LDC countries: the shortage of trained healthcare workers is particularly acute in rural and marginalized communities.
To build relationships with the MoH and other in-country stakeholders, including GSK, to ensure there is buy-in and alignment in program focus and therefore impact: Each NGO will be responsible for establishing a Health Infrastructure Partnerships through which the projects will be selected and funding channeled. These partnerships will include representatives from local healthcare organizations, government officials and the WHO.
To be replicable: The partnership aims to galvanize support to encourage both local and international organizations to make similar commitments in LDCs. We hope to use our learning to influence policy at local, national and international levels to encourage replication and ensure a sustainable impact.
 
Many of the approved projects have been set up in the lower quartile of the LDC index (e.g. Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger), countries where there is very little presence or investment from multinational corporations. Some examples of these include:
Awareness raising for health workers and communities through health promotion in the Cibitoke province in Burundi.
Funding the recruitment and training of community health workers in the remote Kodiolo district in Mali, to improve the levels of preventative and curative health interventions at the community level and strengthen linkages to the public health system.
Improve health services through provision of additional training for health professionals and midwives, whilst successfully advocating for the exemption from user fees system for children and mothers suffering from malnutrition in Burkina Faso, which came into effect in April 2016.
Positively impacting healthy behaviours and mortality rates through midwife and community health worker training in Nepal.
Championing innovative approaches to unlock bottlenecks in access to quality training by supporting the development of e-learning to improve access to quality training for approximately 500 nurses and midwives in Tanzania and Uganda.
Advocate for greater coverage of properly resourced health workers and to strengthen lifesaving healthcare through working closely with health professionals, key decision makers & opinion formers for human resources for health in Togo, Benin, Mali and Niger.
 
In 2015, to increase access to healthcare and deliver long-term economic growth across Africa, GSK expanded health worker training beyond LDCs to Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. Since 2009, £21 million has been invested to improve access to healthcare which has helped train 43,000 health workers. The program has reached 17.5 million people across 39 countries.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
By 2050, the number of individuals aged 60 years or above will have tripled from 600 million in 2000 to two billion. Eighty percent of them will live in low- or middle-income countries, and while these statistics highlight the scale of the challenge society faces, an ageing population provides countless opportunities. Older people are, and will continue to be, vital assets to their families, friends and communities.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The IFRC has developed, tested and started to disseminate a package of tools for use by Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers working with older populations and those who care for them. The toolkit includes content about non-communicable diseases, risk factors such as falls and social isolation, as well as tools which provide guidance and activities to help people pursue healthier lives. The tools will be translated and published in different languages to better reach the communities. Additional tools will also be developed for those who care for older people, which will include content on how they can help to enable healthy ageing with dignity and care. Importantly, the kit aligns with the existing Healthy Lifestyles Community – a highly successful learning and online community –which is used by a number of National Societies worldwide as part of their community-based health programmes. The integration of the kit within community health programmes is an important step, ensuring that collective action is at the forefront of elderly care in communities.
Experiences on strategies, tools and lessons learned are regularly shared for the benefit of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies worldwide wishing to better serve the needs of older people in their communities.
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
There is an increasing demand from National Societies for technical support and capacity building to integrate the new ageing toolkit into their programmes for communities. So far 15 National societies have piloted the tools, and expect global roll out from 2017.
 The new program builds up from existing initiatives within the IFRC movement: Health Ageing is a part of recently developed comprehensive Community-based homecare toolkit in the Europe region, offers National Societies in the region and beyond information and guidance on setting up a community-based home care programme.  Care and support for elderly is key activity of Red Cross Societies in Thailand, Colombia, Argentina.

The health situation in the Arkhangai region of Mongolia is very precarious. The organization of care provision currently suffers from many quality and efficiency problems that have a disastrous impact on maternal and child health, particularly in the region of Arkhangai.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The main objective of the project supported by the Sanofi Espoir Foundation is to improve the quality of care for the population of Arkhangai by boosting the skills of health workers in obstetrics and neonatal care, building networks among all associated stakeholders in maternal and child health in the region, and stepping up the organization of all hospitals involved in the maternal and child care value chain.
It therefore results in improving overall health protection for mothers and children.

            Partnership objectives
The partnership aims to ensure that 10 million patients in Africa with hypertension are on treatments which control their condition by 2025, supporting the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) ‘25 by 25’ global monitoring framework for preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases.
If achieved, this would address a quarter of the WHO’s hypertension target in Africa. Healthy Heart Africa aims to do this by determining the most effective methods of integrating hypertension care into existing health platforms.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is an often-overlooked non-communicable disease that puts patients at high risk of developing more serious cardiovascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Africa has the highest prevalence of adults with hypertension at 46%, and a quarter of all premature deaths in Africa are attributable to the condition. Hypertension causes 7.5 million deaths annually (12.8% of all deaths) and the risk of dying from hypertension in low and middle-income countries is more than double that in high-income countries. Hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD and indicates an increased risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke and other complications. In Africa alone, CVD accounts for one in ten deaths across the continent.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Healthy Heart Africa is designed in consultation and collaboration with non-governmental and community based organizations, international organizations, health experts and governments to support local health systems by increasing awareness of the symptoms and risks of hypertension and by offering education, screening, treatment and control.
The program has three components:
Education and awareness – increasing awareness of the risk factors associated with hypertension and how to prevent it, as well as prompting patients to access screening services.
Providing training and treatment guidelines – supporting training for health and community care workers and developing guidelines with professional societies and the Kenyan Ministry of Health to ensure consistency in the level and quality of care.
Access and affordability – improving access to hypertension treatment and ensuring a consistent supply of low priced, affordable medicines including calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide diuretics.
Given the novel nature of HHA, and the reality that few cost-effective models for NCD care have been proven and scaled in Africa, AstraZeneca launched five different demonstration projects– HHA tested different models across a relatively fragmented healthcare system in order to identify what works and at what cost to inform future scale-up both within Kenya and across the region more broadly. HHA implementing partners have included Ampath, AMREF, Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK), Population Services Kenya (PSK), Jhpiego, and Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB). AstraZeneca also collaborates with Kenya’s Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS), to establish secure supply chains for antihypertensive medicines, and with Abt Associates, to evaluate baseline and endline program data.
The partner program models have explored a number of approaches for improving access to hypertension care, including:
Integrating hypertension and infectious disease programming
Providing hypertension programming across public, social franchise, and faith-based facility networks
Testing uptake of hypertension care in community settings.
This has generated key learnings, described in additional detail below, that have supported the expansion of HHA programming, both in Kenya and Ethiopia.
After 18 months in Kenya, Healthy Heart Africa has already: 
Conducted  over 2 million hypertension screenings in the community and in health facilitites
Activated over 400 health facilities
Trained over 3,000 healthcare workers across 31 counties including doctors, nurses, community health volunteers, and pharmacists to provide education and awareness, screening and treatment services for hypertension
Identified more than 300,000 hypertensive patients
Treated over 80,000 patients
In September 2016, AstraZeneca and PEPFAR (the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) launched a partnership to expand access to HIV and hypertension services across Africa. The partnership will receive $10 million in funds for a five-year global public-private partnership. It will expand access to HIV/AIDS and hypertension services by offering them in an integrated manner at existing PEPFAR-supported HIV/AIDS sites, beginning in Kenya. The new partnership supports the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 on good health and well-being. 
It is optimizing existing HIV/AIDS service delivery infrastructure and more specifically enhancing services for men aged 25-50. Data show that men often access HIV/AIDS testing and treatment at far lower rates than women. For example, according to the most recent Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, 79.8 percent of women surveyed had received an HIV test, whereas only 62.5 percent of men had received one. This significant gender disparity leads to HIV-infected men entering care with more advanced disease, being less likely to receive lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and having higher mortality than HIV-infected women. Late diagnosis also results in missed opportunities for HIV prevention, including early ART initiation, resulting in ongoing transmission to previously uninfected partners.
Launching in October 2016 with a one-year pilot program in Western Kenya, the partnership, in collaboration with the Kenyan Ministry of Health, will leverage PEPFAR’s existing HIV/AIDS infrastructure in Homa Bay and Kisumu. These areas were identified not only due to the high burden for all patients, but particularly working-age males who have not yet been reached by current HIV/AIDS programming. Longer term, the partnership aims to extend to other areas where the burdens of both HIV/AIDS and hypertension are particularly high.
After the success of the HHA program in Kenya, AstraZeneca developed a partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia to integrate HHA programming into the Ethiopian healthcare system in support of the Government of Ethiopia’s National Strategic Action Plan for Non-Communicable Diseases. The HHA partnership in Ethiopia is designed to provide the same programmatic elements that have been successful in Kenya while ensuring their appropriate adoption to meet the needs of the Ethiopian healthcare system by utilizing the Government’s extensive Health Extension Program to bring care closer to the community.
The goal for Ethiopia HHA partnership is to decentralize and scale up high-quality hypertension care and treatment across health facilities in and around Addis Ababa, with eventual expansion to twelve hospitals and thirty-six health centres across seven regions. Program implementation is being adapted in partnership with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health for integration into public facilities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Predictions by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that non-communicable diseases will account for seven out of ten deaths by 2020 and current projections indicate that by that time, the largest increases in NCD deaths will occur in Africa.
Studies in Tanzania also show that NCDs are a growing problem for older people, accounting for nearly 60% of deaths of those 61 and older in some districts.  The Tanzania National Strategy for NCDs identifies cardiovascular diseases, cervical and breast cancers, central diseases of the nervous systems, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases among the NCDs causing the greatest impact.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
HelpAge International and Pfizer have worked together since 2012 to reduce the impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among older people in Tanzania. During its first two years, the initiative focused on raising awareness among older people and health providers, contributing to the Government of Tanzania's efforts to provide age-appropriate health services to older citizens. NCDs included in the scope of the initiative consist of chronic conditions that include cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, as well as Alzheimer's and other dementias. They are commonly thought of as diseases of affluence, whereas, in reality, four-fifths of deaths from NCDs are in low- and middle-income countries, and older people in developing countries are particularly at risk. Prevention through an active and healthy lifestyle can turn some of these debilitating diseases into manageable conditions.
Ongoing HelpAge project work focuses on developing an intergenerational approach to health messaging and strengthening community-based initiatives such as active aging groups. These initiatives stress the role of healthy lifestyles in preventing and managing NCDs; facilitate collaborations with health providers at local and national levels to improve prevention, early diagnosis, follow-up and treatment; and help improve data collection and analyses to inform appropriate policies. Community-based activities are being carried out in the Kibaha district. At the national level, the project supports health advocacy that includes curriculum reform, increasing access to essential NCD drugs, and working with the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Children and Elderly to improve health information management.
HelpAge has developed a robust tool to monitor healthy aging and well-being in older age in a broad range of contexts. Building on field-testing in Bolivia, Colombia, Tanzania, and Uganda, the Health Outcomes Tool is now being implemented in India and in the Philippines. Defining and measuring healthy aging poses a significant challenge. As people age, a progressively delicate balance has to be struck between medicalizing care (when appropriate) to extend life, managing symptoms and disabilities, and maintaining or improving autonomy and quality of life. HelpAge believes that the new tool could address shortcomings of existing measurement tools and enable a redefinition of health outcomes in older age by focusing on health status and functional ability of older people as well as their access to health services.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Recent worldwide data show that each year approximately 10 million babies do not breathe immediately at birth, of which about 6 million require basic neonatal resuscitation. Johnson & Johnson first initiated a program to address birth asphyxia in China in 2004. This partnership between the Chinese Ministry of Health, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Johnson & Johnson demonstrated a 53% decline in birth asphyxia mortality in 360 hospitals surveyed. This success in China led to the expansion of newborn resuscitation efforts to Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa, Uganda and Vietnam.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
The Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) program is a safe births initiative strengthening training programs to help babies breathe at birth and is expected to save the lives of thousands of babies. This effort is being implemented in collaboration with Save the Children, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and USAID. The program aims to increase resuscitation skill capacity of providers at all targeted health facility levels to enable them successfully manage birth asphyxia in newborns; in order to contribute to the reduction in newborn morbidity and mortality due to asphyxia. In-service training to strengthen essential newborn care and neonatal resuscitation capacity for health providers and provision of relevant equipment and supplies will better equip providers and facilities to manage birth asphyxia. In the longer term, this intervention/capacity can be taken up by the Ministries of Health and partners for national scale-up.
The HBB curriculum is designed to be used as part of a coordinated educational approach to early neonatal care and can be locally taught to birth attendants in diverse venues and locations. HBB focuses on practices that all persons who care for babies at birth can learn to care for healthy babies and/or assist babies who do not breathe on their own. To accomplish this goal, HBB has developed a comprehensive training solution, which includes:

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Arthritis is a complex family of musculoskeletal disorders consisting of more than 100 different diseases or conditions that destroy joints, bones, muscles, cartilage and other connective tissues, hampering or halting physical movement.
Arthritis affects one in every 1,000 children and adolescents, and those affected have painful, stiff joints, which make it difficult for them to carry heavy items such as schoolbags. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common form of arthritis in children, and differs significantly from arthritis commonly seen in adults (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis).
Although JIA is a chronic disease, access to appropriate treatment is vital so children can enjoy a normal life with reduced risk of future disability. In addition, there is a need for clear, accurate information about the disease, treatment and the key role played by both teachers and caregivers, to help support youngsters who suffer from JIA.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To provide a general understanding of how a child relates to JIA, and deliver useful tools to help improve their daily lives, Roche developed and published a guide to JIA, in conjunction with physicians from Pedro Elizalde Hospital.
The first such guide to be published in Argentina, the material’s high visual and narrative impact helps to explain the illness and, thus, the quality of life of children suffering from it. The guide’s five easy-to-read chapters, and an appendix with games, provide ideas on how to explain the disease to a child and general information for parents, teachers and caregivers.
As part of the guide’s launch, Roche organises one event per year, where all play, teach and learn with JIA patients and their families while enjoying a unique experience that focuses on the beauty of being a child and enjoying life. Roche works hard to adapt the event activities to their needs and make sure they learn not only from doctors, but also from their friends. Roche offers parents the opportunity to share their experiences to show other JIA patients and their families that they are not alone and that leading a normal life just like everyone else is possible.
During the last four years, more than 2000 guides were distributed among Hospitals, Schools, Institutions and Families. Also, the event has gathered more than 800 people, including JIA patients and their families.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Of the 350 million people chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide, around 100 million live in China. HBV is a main cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancer. People with hepatitis are often unaware of their infection or simply do not have access to treatment in China.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In order to help this situation, Roche has established diagnostic capacity and medical training to improve know-how for wider access to correct treatment regimes. Diagnostics play a key role in developing targeted medicines and in combining drugs with sophisticated tests that assess whether a patient is likely to respond to treatment. Today, over 60% of new Roche compounds are developed in conjunction with a diagnostic test.
Both its Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions work closely together to ensure the right treatment is offered to the right patient.
Given the prevalence of Hepatitis B in China, it is vital to identify those patient sub-groups most likely to benefit from a targeted therapy. As a result, more and more patients see improved outcomes. This integrated approach means the patient’s quality of life is enormously improved and resources are used optimally.
In China, Roche is piloting a number of differential pricing models in partnership with local NGOs and government organisations. The aim is to tailor prices to the needs of patients and healthcare providers across countries, and within population segments, based on their ability to pay. This program has seen the treatment Pegasys (for Hepatitis B and C), grow from reaching 8,000 patients in 2010 to reaching 14,000 patients in 2013.

Hemophilia is a rare, chronic, lifelong condition.
An estimated 400,000 people worldwide are living with hemophilia, but only 25% receive adequate treatment.
Especially in low and middle income countries, barriers to care include lack of diagnosis, limited institutional capacity and insufficient access to treatment.
Prophylaxis at home is the standard of care in developed countries, but in India this is not standard, due to low awareness, limited capacity, and absence of treatment guidelines, amongst others
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Shire piloted a project in Mumbai, in partnership with King Edward Medical College (KEM), to build capacity and generate evidence for an effective, first-of-its-kind, hemophilia home care model in India to reduce bleeds. With Shire’s support, KEM was able to adopt a home care protocol, obtain training material, deploy software technology, allocate human resources and set up the infrastructure for home administration of clotting factor. KEM also trained parents and care givers on home administration.
Following this positive outcome, Shire expanded the project to the Civil Hospital Surat in Gujarat, and to the District Hospital Aluwa Kerala to establish a “hub-and-spoke” system of high standard hemophilia care in states in India. The program kicks off a journey, to bring the appropriate standard of hemophilia care to patients in India, with a view to enable children with hemophilia to live their life to the fullest.
Measurement of progress towards objectives:
Estimated amount of people impacted: within two years, (starting 2015), the number of patients on home prophylactic treatment went from 0 to an estimated 100 in 2017.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Many first-generation vaccines have not been developed with the specific needs of countries with poor infrastructure for vaccine delivery in mind. This is a much-needed exploration of how to tackle one of the greatest public health and logistics challenges in the developing world-distributing life-saving vaccines without the requirement for large bulk shipments, expensive warehousing and costly, difficult-to-maintain refrigerated shipping paths from the manufacturing plant to the patient.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In September 2009, the Wellcome Trust and Merck* & Co., Inc. (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) created the MSD Welcome Trust Hilleman Laboratories, a research and development joint venture with a not-for-profit mission committed to developing high impact, affordable vaccines for people in developing countries in an innovative and sustainable manner.
The partners have strengths that are complementary in many ways. The Wellcome Trust brings exceptional public health expertise, in-depth policy understanding and experience in biomedical research to the partnership. MSD brings expertise in vaccine development and experience in working with a diverse range of stakeholders including international organizations, governments, nongovernmental organizations and philanthropic organizations.
The Hilleman Laboratories is based in India and is focused on bringing in innovation to act as a catalyst in bridging the gap between academia and product development, leveraging a cadre of talented scientists from around the globe. Their expertise in medical research is targeted towards creating new vaccines in areas of unmet needs as well as adapting existing vaccines for more effective delivery in low income countries.
Numerous barriers hamper access to live-saving vaccines for millions of people living in the developing world. First, the lack of commercial return has limited private sector investment in new solutions for diseases that predominantly affect low income countries. Secondly, many licensed vaccines available in the market today were developed and manufactured with industrialized world citizens in mind.
Hilleman Laboratories aims to create a novel immunization platform by employing modern technologies focusing on:
Thermostability
Ease-of-administration
Reduced footprint
Affordability
Over the long-term, Hilleman Laboratories seeks to collaborate, exchange ideas and build a meaningful dialogue and advocacy platform for vaccine discovery to ultimately strengthen public health systems and immunization programs in developing countries.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Beginning in mid-2012, a new management team was put in place at Hilleman Laboratories (HL) led by industry veterans, Dr. Davinder Gill as CEO and Gerd Zettlmeissl as Chairman of the Board of Directors.  HL has sharpened its focus on translational research to advance development of vaccines against enteric diseases that disproportionately impact people living in developing countries in Asia and Africa. 
Consistent with this strategy, current research at HL is aimed at a major, unmet need for low income countries, namely developing a more thermostable, affordable rotavirus vaccine. Using innovative lyophilization and spray drying technologies, HL has made significant progress in developing new formulations of an optimized rotavirus vaccine with highly thermostable profiles that can better withstand the harsh conditions in developing countries. It will allow for greater temperature consistency and less reliance on exact storage timing and refrigeration.
In addition, the Hilleman Laboratories has also advanced partnership efforts to advance novel vaccine candidates for cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) mediated infection, leading causes of diarrheal disease in impoverished settings. HL in collaboration with Gotovax AB aims to deliver a high impact Oral Cholera vaccine at a significantly more affordable price than the ones currently available in the market. Easy to administer, with cross protection against ETEC diarrhea and enhanced with a longer shelf life, this vaccine candidate will be most suited for geographies with the highest cholera burden like Africa and South Asia.
Finally, the Labs are exploring creative, low cost solutions for delivery and packaging, to simplify vaccine administration in the field.  To guide development, HL continues to obtain external input from the global health community through routine consultation with its Strategic Advisory Group and other stakeholders.

Since 2000, BMS has operated a multifaceted program designed to improve access to HIV/AIDS medicines in countries that are among the most significantly impacted by the pandemic and have the fewest resources to combat it. The program rests upon three pillars:
Antiretroviral pricing that reflects no profit for the company in sub-Saharan Africa and msot low-income countries;
An HIV/AIDS medicines patent policy that reflects a commitment to access through generic manufacturer participation in sub-Saharan Africa and India;
Partnering with others who share in a commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS.
Bristol-Myers Squibb’s HIV Global ACCESS Program operates in more than 60 countries around the world in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. The company also offers tiered pricing for HIV/AIDS products in middle-income countries.
BMS was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to offer no-profit pricing for HIV/AIDS medicines in sub-Saharan Africa and most low income countries. In addition, BMS engages in tiered pricing in middle-income countries based on a number of factors, including affordability and government commitment to care.

Description of partnership activities and how they address the needs and challenges
In response to this challenge, the HIVACAT program was launched to design, develop and test potential HIV vaccine candidates in clinical trials for further development and regulatory approval. HIVACAT is a joint effort of two leading European HIV research institutions in Barcelona – The Hospital Clinic and Irsicaixa, and the pharmaceutical company, Esteve. This consortium also has the support of the Obra Social “La Caixa” Foundation (“Fundació la Caixa”) and two organizations of the government of the Generalitat de Catalunya (the Department of Health and the Department of Innovation, Universities and Companies). HIVACAT brings together the expertise and projects of more than 60 investigators from The Hospital Clinic and Irsicaixa, in addition to multiple international collaborations with leading HIV research organizations and institutions in Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Americas.
Esteve's involvement consists in providing expertise in intellectual property, regulatory affairs, GMP production, GLP regulatory studies, and other aspects of preclinical and clinical development, in addition to providing funding. The program tackles some of the current roadblocks in HIV vaccine design, including the incomplete knowledge of host immune control of HIV, viral sequence diversity and adequate vaccine vector design. Overall, the program focuses in a holistic approach (“from bench to bed”) structured in 8 highly interactive lines of investigation that address topics of cellular and humoral immunity to HIV and their relationship with viral control, assess the impact of viral sequence diversity and host genetics on vaccine immunogen design, neutralizing antibodies, and study the function of dendritic cells as vaccine carriers. It contains a straightforward path to design preventive vaccine approaches and select the most promising candidates for clinical trials. The work is strongly supported by a unique patient and sample source access (created over more than 15 years) and the combination of innovative approaches in HIV vaccine design with the technical expertise of an extensive number of well-established researchers in HIV immunology, immunopathogenesis, and virology. Important papers on the research in HIVACAT have been published.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among females, and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, with the continued economic growth in Asia, many countries are making efforts to expand Universal Health Coverage (UHC), however due to financial challenges and operational issues, the coverage is limited with only essential medicines usually covered. Furthermore, economic growth leads to wider income disparity, forcing lower income patients who are not covered by insurance to pay out-of-pocket to access innovative medicines.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Aiming to fulfil the gap between current reimbursement coverage and achievement of full UHC, Hope to Her was initiated in some Asian countries to ensure patients’ access to our innovative metastatic breast cancer treatment where it is not reimbursed by UHC. Eisai developed intra-country pricing models with different tiers including price zero, by considering socio-economic factors, treatment cycle, patients and their families’ benefits and so on. Third-parties (financial assessment agency, public foundation, etc.) help to make independent assessments on patients’ financial status in order to determine which tier they should be allocated to, as well as guidance on drug compliance, tracking progression of health status and so on.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Patients who gained access to our innovative metastatic breast cancer treatment through Hope to Her accounts for about 37% of the total patients who have been benefiting from this treatment in India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar.

In times of disasters and emergencies there is an imperative to respond quickly to ensure lives are saved and protected from disease outbreaks that often follow.
GSK partners with humanitarian aid partners, experienced in the distribution of medicines, who follow WHO guidelines for medicines donations, ensuring that medicine donations are appropriate to the needs and of maximum benefit to the recipients.
GSK is one of the pharmaceutical industry’s major donors of medical products supporting disaster relief efforts and long-term healthcare programs.
The humanitarian product donation program is a fundamental part of GSK’s community investment activities to help save lives and improve the quality of life of people living in vulnerable situations, whether caused by a sudden unexpected emergency such as a disaster, or as a result of a chronic lack of available medicines for which longer-term, ongoing humanitarian aid is needed and where GSK’s medicines can really make a significant difference.
Humanitarian product donations underpin GSK’s global mission to improve the quality of human life by enabling people to do more, feel better and live longer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GSK’s approach to medicine donations is unique.  The Company works with carefully selected charity partners – AmeriCares, Project HOPE, Direct Relief, IMA (Interchurch Medical Assistance) and MAP International - who are experts in the distribution of medicines.  They are able to select from GSK inventory which means that they have access to long dated, high quality products which meet the needs of communities.  Their experience of community healthcare ensures that the right medicines reach people in need at the right time and because the products are pre-positioned in the partners’ warehouses, held in storage, they are able to respond swiftly, often within days of  a disaster occurring.
The partners also draw upon their stock of medicines in their warehouses to support longer-term healthcare programs in areas where medicines are either unavailable or there are gaps in healthcare provision.
GSK’s partners also support programs targeting specific therapy areas, such as Direct Relief, providing hospitals in East Africa with donations of GSK’s anti-emetic medicines, which support patients undergoing cancer treatment which would otherwise be unavailable.
Through MAP International and their Medical Mission program, GSK’s medicines reach a high number of small, remote communities. Each Medical Mission pack, which physicians in the US can apply for to take with them on their overseas medical mission trips, contains antibiotics and other essential medicines donated by GSK.  
Since 2012 GSK has been working with partners, including Save the Children, Red Cross and Americares, Direct Relief and UNHCR, to provide cash and product donations, supporting displaced children and families in affected countries.
Working across three country phases: `countries of origin', `countries of transition' and `countries of destination', GSK is taking a strategic, longer term approach to address the needs of refugee communities.
To date GSK has contributed over US$ 5m, supporting the following countries: Croatia, Gaza, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Spain, Syria, Serbia, Somalia
Local businesses also supported with local donations of hygiene and essential items in Austria and Germany.
Funding is being used to provide
Healthcare in refugee communities, including emergency, mobile units and primary health. This also includes delivering immunisation programmes in humanitarian situations where governments are unable to respond.
Child protection, especially for unaccompanied children who are the most vulnerable
Strengthen capacity for response at the country level to prioritise and implement programmes with key partners
Cash and Product Donations
In addition, in times of emergencies, GSK also make grants (cash donations) in response to funding appeals received from major aid agencies such as the Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies or Save the Children.  The funds can be quickly put to use in disaster situations to mobilise essential emergency supplies in the immediate short-term, supporting local government or other emergency response activities.
GSK’s contribution to humanitarian relief goes beyond these medicine and cash donations to our partners.  GSK volunteers regularly play their part in assisting partners, offering their expertise on 3-6 month secondment ‘PULSE’ placements -  helping to improve the delivery of healthcare and access to medicines in the countries where the partners operate.   And, in times of disasters, increasing numbers of GSK employees offer their medical expertise to assist in the delivery of local medicine donations and gifts-in-kind, as well as to raise funds which help to speed up and augment local recovery efforts.
Lessons learned                            
Trusted partnerships are key to the humanitarian product donation program’s success.  GSK has been working with the five partners over  a long period of time, in the case of Project HOPE, for example, stretching back over 50 years.
Robust governance structures are needed to ensure medicine donations reach the right people at the right time and provide maximum benefit. GSK’s program is managed centrally by the Global Health programs Community Partnerships function that facilitates the relationship between GSK and the carefully selected charity partners. These undergo rigorous due diligence and annual legal agreements are put in place to manage GSK’s product donations.
Tracking donations to their intended destination is a key part of the contract with non-profit partners. GSK country managers and the Community Partnerships team have participated in field visits, talking to doctors and patients to be assured that GSK products are being dispensed appropriately and improving people’s health.
GSK’s has also endorsed an internal global Humanitarian Product Donation policy to reinforce the company’s commitment to a strategic and integrated approach of supplying products for humanitarian needs. This also clarifies that GSK does not donate medicines for chronic diseases, where a continuous supply of product is required – instead a sustainable policy of preferential pricing has been implemented for the least developed countries.
A key principle of the donations policy is that country managers approve donations before they are delivered to their markets.  This ensures that medicines are appropriate to the needs of the country and avoids potential conflict with commercial business.  Further, GSK managers play an active role in creating strong partnerships at a local level with charities and healthcare workers who distribute and dispense GSK medicines.
GSK’s senior managers recognise that the pharmaceutical industry has a unique and clear purpose in responding to humanitarian needs.  When major disasters occur, such as those in the Philippines, the Community Partnerships team in partnership with the heads of the affected country/region, helps to convene a ‘crisis committee’ that brings together relevant functions such as senior managers of manufacturing, commercial, human resources and corporate communications to ensure a rapid and coordinated response.  GSK can make a tangible difference and stakeholders such as employees and governments recognise this.
GSK and its partners are members of the Partnership for Quality Medical Donations (PQMD), an alliance of pharmaceutical companies and non-government organisations who work together to promote best practice in medicine donations and community healthcare. Close coordination of the members, especially during disasters, ensures high visibility of each other’s work and mitigates duplication of effort.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2016 GSK provided medicines and vaccines valued at £2.5m (Cost of Goods) for humanitarian purposes to 87 of the world’s poorest countries. It is an area where GSK can make a significant impact because they manufacture products that save lives threatened by infections or injuries.
GSK employees are enormously proud of what the company does for humanitarian relief.
GSK country managers and the Community Partnerships team have participated in field visits, talking to partners, doctors and patients to be assured that GSK products are being dispensed appropriately and improving people’s health.  They witness first-hand the poor conditions of geographically remote health centres, where there is often no running water and limited medical equipment.  They recognise that it is a ‘win-win’ if medicines can be donated for the most impoverished people who would not otherwise be treated. They appreciate that GSK can intervene in a practical way with additional supplies of essential medicines that save people’s lives and that this can be reflected in the recognition they receive from governments, physicians and healthcare providers.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Cancer has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Globally, it kills more than 8.2 million people every year, which is more than the total fatalities from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.  The majority of deaths occur in LMICs and it is projected that more than 9 million people in these countries will lose their battle with cancer annually by 2030.  In addition to demographic and lifestyle changes, LMICs suffer from a poor or non-existent cancer control infrastructure as well as a shortage of sufficiently trained human resources. This partnership is the first collaboration of its kind and will open further possibilities for joint public-private efforts to curb cancer. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
IFPMA and its members, with an additional contribution from Bristol-Myers Squibb, support the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) to promote comprehensive cancer control. It will focus on critical areas including awareness raising, resource mobilization, and capacity building.
This collaboration is centred on helping to ensure cancer is a health priority at national and global levels, and supporting stronger health system capacities to ensure overall cancer information and care is available in low and middle income countries (LMICs).
This initiative will help IAEA’s PACT programme engage with private partnerships to support and raise funds for comprehensive cancer control projects and to implement communication and awareness raising strategies in LMICs. The two organizations will also collaborate on training and educating the healthcare workforce in LMICs to improve cancer control and invest in healthcare solutions. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In addition, the initiative will help strengthen the Virtual University for Cancer Control (VUCCnet) – a PACT online service that provides cancer related courses adapted to suit cancer services available in the four participating countries. It offers customized, accessible, high-quality, and freely available training across all stages of the cancer care continuum.
VUCCnet courses are designed to develop the skills of medical professionals and offer master level courses to complement student learning. VUCCnet is in the process of further developing its curriculum, which has been rolled out in 33 sub-Saharan African countries after a successful pilot phase. To date, the service has trained over 500 African health professionals and potentially reached over 10,000 cancer patients.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In emerging countries, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are becoming an increasingly serious issue, and the United Nations (UN) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) have called on pharmaceutical companies to take action not only in the area of communicable diseases (CDs) but also in the area of NCDs.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Project HOPE, a global health education and humanitarian assistance organization, partnered with Takeda to launch the International Diabetes Educator E-Learning (IDEEL) Program. IDEEL is packaged as a self-paced online learning program/curricula that can be accessed from anywhere. The program is enhanced by a minimum 15 day clinical internship under the guidance of an endocrinologist and diabetes educator. Once the student has successfully completed the online course and internship, he/she will have a life-enhancing understanding of diabetes management across a broad range of age groups. Takeda has been supporting the developing online course of the program and expansion from India to other emerging countries since 2013.  
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
IDEEL program has been successfully initiated in the month of September 2013 in India. Project HOPE is aiming to go live with the Spanish version early 2014. Following Spanish (or simultaneously pending funding), Takeda is also interested in the development of a Mandarin, Portuguese, Arabic and French not to mention various English versions for different English-speaking target populations around the world.
The program is targeting 800 enrollees by the end of June 2014 and another 1200 for the period July 2014- June 2015.

The Millennium Villages Project (MVP) was founded with the goal of helping impoverished communities in rural Africa achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), formulated and agreed on by all member countries of the United Nations. The MVP is active at 14 sites in 10 African countries.
In 2007 the Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development (NFSD) began support of the Millennium Villages Project (MVP) in health-related research interventions. The MVP was founded with the goal of helping impoverished communities in rural Africa achieve the MDGs. Over five years the NFSD is investing in the transition of Ilolangulu village in Tanzania from mainly subsistence farming to more self-sustaining commercial activity.
The NFSD also donated ACT Coartem for the treatment of malaria in MVP sites all over sub-Saharan Africa where Coartem is registered on the national essential drugs list.
Lessons learned
The MVP shows that fighting poverty at a village level through community-led development is an effective way of reaching the MDGs.        
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
In 2011 the villages of the Mbola cluster are increasingly self-financing and experiencing growth in business and entrepreneurship. The cluster formation of the villages is clearly an essential part of this success, allowing all villages to benefit from lower costs, shared investments and distributed knowledge. In total 4,253 patients were reached with improved health services and products in Ilolangulu in 2010; new clinics, dispensaries and health outreach programs in many surrounding villages have reduced the burden on the village’s health facility.
Looking ahead, access to agricultural finance and the promotion of business development need to be scaled up for the benefit of all communities. Expansion of the electricity grid and the introduction of alternative energy sources such as SharedSolar panels must continue so that power sources are accessible to all. It is also vital that power is available in locations such as health centers and schools where it is most needed. Piped water systems and large scale irrigation projects need to be expanded to maintain the cleanliness of local water sources, and there is a clear need for further community awareness schemes on protecting fresh water springs and using latrines. Additionally, cluster-wide mobile telephone and internet connections need to be broadened and improved.

            Partnership objectives
MSD* supports the ambitious, but achievable, goal set out by the global reproductive health community in 2012 of ensuring that voluntary life-saving family planning information, services and products reach an additional 120 million women and girls in the world’s poorest countries by 2020. They also support the UN Commission on Life-saving Commodities for Women and Children’s call to improve equitable access to 13 overlooked commodities, including contraceptive implants. The IMPLANON Access Initiative seeks to support both of these goals.

            What are the needs and challenges? 
The unmet need for family planning, particularly in developing countries, has been well-documented. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 222 million women in developing countries have an unmet need for family planning. Of these, 162 million women live in the world’s poorest countries. The impact is significant:
Half a million women die each year due to complications of child birth
80 million unplanned pregnancies
30 million unplanned births
40 million abortions every year
Research has shown that for every $1 spent on family planning, $6 can be saved. In fact, global health experts estimate that investing $8.1 billion a year in voluntary family planning would:
Reduce unintended pregnancies by more than 60 percent
Prevent 30% of maternal deaths
Avert 20% of newborn deaths
Reduce unsafe abortion by 40%
Governments, donors and international funding organizations realize that investing in family planning is not only good for health, but is necessary for economic development. It increases productivity for girls and women, helps to develop a more sustainable world, and positively affects population dynamics. As USAID has stated, it “targets the symptoms of and pathways out of poverty.”
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In July 2011, MSD and the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition (RHSC) announced a partnership to enhance access and appropriate and effective use of the company’s long-acting reversible contraceptive implant IMPLANON® (68 mg etonogestrel implant) for qualified buyers in developing countries. Under the initiative, IMPLANON was available at MSD’s lowest access price to donor agencies and family planning members of RHSC in sub-Saharan Africa, and in all other Low Income countries as defined by the World Bank and Lower Middle Income countries with maternal mortality ratios of >200 according to UN data.
Less than one year later, in November 2012, RHSC announced that the initiative had met its initial target of supplying 4.5 million units of the product, triggering a further credit rebate for the eligible recipient countries.
In May 2013, building on the company’s previous price announcement, MSD and a group of public- and private-sector partners announced an agreement to further expand contraceptive access and options for millions of women in some of the world’s poorest countries. The increased volume generated from the success of the initial initiative with RHSC and the guarantee of continued volume has allowed MSD to achieve improved economies of scale making the further price reduction possible.
Under the agreement, MSD will reduce the cost of IMPLANON and its next-generation implant, IMPLANON NXT® (68 mg etonogestrel implant), radiopaque, by approximately 50 percent for the next six years in the targeted poorest eligible countries of focus for the reproductive health community. These countries are those with a 2010 per capita gross national income less than or equal to US$2,500 per year based on the World Bank classification using the Atlas Method. They are thought least likely to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the UN General Assembly in 1990 to reduce the number of infant and young child deaths by two-thirds and to improve maternal health by 2015. Collectively they are referred to as the FP2020 countries.
In the countries where MSD products are included in family planning programs, they work closely with ministries of health and local implementing partners, who play a pivotal role in supporting training, counseling and other related activities. Local implementing partners have included Jhpiego, EngenderHealth, Marie Stopes International, International Planned Parenthood Federation, Population Services International, Pathfinder International and DKT. Such collaboration ensures that countries have the expertise and support they need to achieve their reproductive health objectives.
Lessons learned
Communication with all partners is critical to making a partnership work. This includes ensuring accurate forecasting in order to meet product demand.
Making the product available to the local purchasing or recipient entity is not enough; the private sector can play an important role working with other stakeholders to ensure the product gets to the women who need it.
The voice of the customer is as important in developing countries as it is in developed countries. It’s important for the private sector to listen to needs and desires of women, providers and other stakeholders to ensure we are best able to meet them.
The role of community-based health workers is critical in raising awareness of family planning and the options available so that women, particularly those outside urban centers, can make voluntary, informed choices.
Strong support from donors, governments and the private sector for capacity building for implant service delivery is essential for increasing access.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2013, more than 4 million women had access to IMPLANON/NXT in FP2020 program through the IMPLANON Access Initiative. MSD worked with more than 35 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Central America to provide IMPLANON and IMPLANON NXT through numerous partnerships with governments, donors and non-government organizations.
Moving forward, MSD continues to work with stakeholders to address barriers beyond price, including regulatory approvals, logistics and supply chain management, health provider training, and awareness creation and demand generation efforts.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
It is estimated that 536,000 women worldwide die of maternal causes, along with 11,000,000 children under five, of which 4.4 million are newborns. The majority of these deaths occur in Sub Saharan Africa. Tanzania is one of the ten countries contributing to 61% and 66% of the global total of maternal and newborn deaths, respectively.
Maternal and newborn health care in Tanzania faces many challenges including a critical shortage of adequately skilled maternal health service providers; and constraints around uptake of, and access to these health services due to barriers including distance to the nearest facility, the lack of affordable transport at the time of labor, and obtaining skilled and affordable care upon arrival at a health facility.
The average distance to the nearest hospital in rural Tanzania is 31.7km and only 5% of health centers are equipped to provide Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This project will address the need for improved maternal health service delivery in 6 zones across Tanzania; specifically recognizing geographically disadvantaged areas that face limited access to emergency obstetric care; and shortages of adequately skilled maternity health care providers.
The project will strengthen the capacity of practicing, and re-engaged rural midwives across the country through Emergency Skills training workshops, co-delivered on location, by Tanzanian-Canadian midwife pairs. It will also focus on linking the right competencies with rural areas, by identifying traditional birth attendants (TBA) in target communities, and bringing them together with re-engaged retired midwives within those same settings, for mentorship, and skills sharing support - strengthening the continuum of care from home to health facility.
Various tools will be created to enhance midwifery knowledge transfer and advocacy; and essential resources will be provided to support increased access to quality midwifery care.

According to Moscow Research Oncological Institute 2012 report, some 130,000 patients in Russia have CRC, and approximately 26% have metastic colorectoral cancer (mCRC.) The impact of CRC on population health is underestimated, largely due to the lack of a national screening program and limited access to innovative drugs and treatment. Colorectoral cancer is an increasing problem in the Russian Federation, which has the largest incidence of CRC among the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2011, Merck Serono, the pharmaceutical division of Merck, has been supporting the RUSSCO (Interregional Public Organization 'Society of Medical Oncologists') program 'Improvement of the molecular genetic testing in the Russian Federation'.  The objective of the program is to make RAS testing available for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer across Russia. In the 2006 treatment guidelines for CRC, RAS testing was neither included nor was the cost of testing covered by mandatory health insurance. This program has helped draw attention of Russian government officials to CRC issues. To date, almost 6,500 patients have received RAS testing for genetic mutations. In addition, Merck is running the External Quality Insurance Project in cooperation with Pathology Institute of MLU, Munich through which 7 labs have successfully been validated for RAS testing.

GSK wants to ensure affordable access to new and existing antibiotics to the patients who need them, no matter where they live or how much they can afford. GSK also encourages appropriate use of these antibiotics. It is also committed to ensuring access to vaccines, which reduce infections that are often treated with antibioitics.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
GSK recognises that access to medicines and healthcare should be available to everyone who needs them, no matter where they live or how much they can afford. In many countries, we still need to improve access to essential existing antibiotics. We also need to ensure access to new antibiotics once they are launched. However, considering the growing threat of resistance, access should be combined with appropriate use of current and future antibiotic products, as well as improved access to vaccines and infection control, to reduce society’s dependence on antibiotics. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To support access to existing GSK antibiotics, GSK applies tiered pricing based on a country’s wealth and ability to pay, capping the prices of medicines in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) at no more than 25% of prices charged in developed countries (see case study).
For new products, GSK has expanded a graduated approach to patents and intellectual property (IP) to widen access to medicines in the world’s poorest countries. GSK does not file for patent protection in Least Developed and Low Income Countries and we will seek to grant licences to generic manufacturers to supply versions of GSK antibiotics in Lower Middle Income Countries.
To improve access to vaccines, GSK partners with Gavi, which funds immunisation programmes for some of the world’s poorest countries. Gavi-eligible countries always get our lowest prices, which can be as little as one-tenth of those for developed nations. GSK has committed to freeze vaccine prices for graduating countries for ten years. GSK will provide Gavi with more than 850 million vaccine doses at reduced prices to help protect 300 million children in the developing world by 2024.
GSK also globally supplies a range of high quality, affordable consumer healthcare products over the counter (OTC medicines) thereby helping to ensure that patients with common health problems and infections, which do not require antibiotics, can access OTC medicines to help manage their symptoms.
GSK is involved in many community-based projects which contribute to the prevention and control of infections. It re-invests 20% of profits made in LDCs back into improving the healthcare infrastructure and educating communities in those countries to recognise diseases and refer to health services; since 2009 GSK has invested in 35 LDCs, helping support the training of 40,000 frontline health workers and reaching 11 million people. GSK also invests in Personal Hygiene and Sanitation Education (PHASE) for children in the world’s poorest countries and, through partnership with Save the Children, it has developed an antiseptic gel to prevent umbilical cord infections in newborn infants.
Corresponding principle in Declaration by the Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology and Diagnostics Industries on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance
“As part of the WHO Global Action Plan’s proposal for a comprehensive program of sanitation, hygiene, vaccination, infection control, education, and stewardship, we support mechanisms to ensure affordable access to new and existing antibiotics to the patients who need them, in all parts of the world and at all levels of income” and
“We encourage infection control via improved hygiene, vaccination, and preventive treatments to help reduce the number of infections needing antibiotic treatment.”

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Egypt has one of the highest burdens of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the world, with a 10% prevalence of chronic HCV infection among persons aged 15–59 years.
Of the 84 million people in Egypt, around 15% are infected with the Hepatitis C virus and with an additional 165,000 new infections per year, this represents a major threat to public health. This leads to a high mortality from chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer. Affordability of treatment is a significant problem. Due to budget constraints, the Egyptian government was unable to treat all patients with pegylated interferon, Roche’s primary treatment for HCV.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2006 Roche started working with the Egyptian government to establish a national project for treating chronic Hepatitis C. Part of the project included packaging Pegasys locally in a different form (vial vs. a pre-filled syringe) and under a different trade name (Pegferon vs. Pegasys). This allowed for the introduction of differential pricing within Egypt, with Pegferon available at a significantly reduced price to the government, compared to the form sold in the private sector under the Pegasys brand.
In addition, Roche partnered with a local manufacturer in Egypt to package and distribute the pegferon. This involved sharing manufacturing and supply chain management practices, thereby building local capabilities and expertise and generating local employment.
Roche also offers products for diagnosis and treatment monitoring along with awareness programs, helping to maximise medical service and patient benefit.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since the project launched in 2006, more than 160,000 patients have been treated with Pegferon who otherwise may not have received treatment. Additionally, this helped strengthen Roche’s relationship with the Ministry of Health, and with both public and medical societies.

             What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year, more than 150,000 children are diagnosed with cancer while the International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that 300,000 children worldwide actually develop cancer. This disease touches all regions of the world and impacts countless families and communities. With access to quality care, more than 80% of children with cancer can survive, living full and healthy lives. However, many children in low-income and middle income countries do not receive or complete care, and, as a result, over 90% of childhood cancer deaths occur in low resource settings.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Under the umbrella of the WeCare program, Celgene has become a corporate sponsor of World Child Cancer, whose mission is to improve cancer diagnosis, treatment and support for children in the developing world. This organization supports children with cancer in developing countries through its network of international hospitals and volunteer specialists with teams on the ground. World Child Cancer is one of the few organizations involved in the twinning of international hospitals and volunteer specialists with teams on the ground. Current projects exist is Bangladesh, Malawi, Ghana, Myanmar, Mexico Philippines and Cameroon in addition to a collaborative Wilms Tumor project in sub-Saharan Africa.
The partnership that Celgene has built with World Child Cancer since 2011 goes beyond financial donations. For example, Celgene UK/Ireland has been involved in a sponsored walk, donated to raffles and participated in a bike-a-thon. Celgene has been recognized by World Child Cancer as its official corporate sponsor, and was featured in the Financial Times newspaper campaign as its charity of choice during the Annual Seasonal Appeal in December 2013.
The WeCare program includes a specific initiative for World Child Cancer called Box-a-Bear, where Celgene collects teddy bears/soft toys and sends them to children’s hospitals in developing countries. This initiative and the quantities of donations are continuously advertised to the employees at the UK affiliate, and to date more than 3,200 bears have been donated.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
World Child Cancer UK is a charitable trust registered with the Charity Commission in the UK that was founded in 2007. World Child Cancer US is the sister charity based in the US. Together, their mission is to improve the rate of diagnosis, accessibility of treatment and quality of support for children with cancer, and their families, in the developing world.
World Child Cancer builds and funds partnerships which link together hospitals in the developing world with childhood cancer units in developed countries. Many of the world's leading hospitals, including St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital and the Dana Farber/Boston Children’s Hospital in the US, and Royal Victoria Infirmary and University College Hospital in the UK, as well as doctors and nurses give their time for free – training healthcare professionals around the world where they are needed most. This voluntary medical aid enables World Child Cancer to fund vital services and tools to ensure children and their families receive the support they need.
Some of World Child Cancer’s recent successes include:
Support for over 12,400 children. In 2015, they supported almost 4,000 children and trained 1,500 healthcare professionals.
Providing follow-up support to 95% of young patients in Cameroon to ensure they adhere to their treatments and seek medical advice when necessary. 
In 2015, working with partners in Malawi, 250 children were diagnosed with cancer – up from just 80 in 2009. 
Laying the foundations for their first Family Homestay in Cameroon which will enable parents to stay on the hospital site whilst their child is being treated. 
Launching a palliative care programme in Bangladesh for children with cancer who cannot be cured.
Opening their first Hospital School – the Heroes School – so children in Myanmar can continue with their education whilst receiving treatment.
Launching their first Social Enterprise project, working with the Parent Support Groups in Cameroon and Ghana to develop income-generating activities to support families whilst they are at the hospital for long periods.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Breast and gastric cancer are among the most common cancers in Asia. The incidence rates remain low, although they are increasing faster than in Western countries due to changes in lifestyle and diet. HER2-positive cancer is a particularly aggressive form that affects about one-in-five people with breast or gastric cancer.
Samples of a patient’s tumour must be tested for HER2 before treatment starts, in order to determine the most appropriate treatment option. The accuracy of the test is critical, requiring proficiency in tissue collection and processing, as well as laboratory procedures and interpretation of the test results. 
Without reliable diagnostic testing, clinicians are unable to effectively screen for cancer, diagnose disease and develop care plans. 
In Asia there is a critical shortage of reliable laboratories providing quality testing results, along with qualified pathologists and technical personal (histo-technologists).  This is compounded by the limited opportunities for professional education and training, and the more general lack of resources needed to strengthen healthcare systems. This contributes to the majority of cancers not being diagnosed until they reach an advanced stage of disease when it is often too late for a cure.
This highlights the need for educational programs to increase the number of pathologists and histo-technicians in the region, combined with programs to strengthen the skills of the current workforce.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2010 Roche launched the SPHERE program (Scientific Partnership for HER2 Testing Excellence) in Asia-Pacific. The aim is to help integrate HER2 testing of breast and gastric cancer patients at the point of disease diagnosis.
Developed with experts, SPHERE is designed to improve pathologists and histo-technicians skills around all aspects of tissue testing processes, starting with HER2 driven disease. The training includes plenary presentations and workshops, with hands-on laboratory experience and interactive microscope sessions. The aim is to increase the reliability and reproducibility of HER2 testing by:
Training surgeons on taking and handling tissue biopsies
Establishing training and quality control procedures for lab technicians
Assisting pathologists in scoring and interpreting results
Educating oncologists on the need for reliable HER2 testing and the link to treatment decisions
In addition, the program aims to educate, share best practice and facilitate collaboration between all health workers in the management of cancer care - surgeons, technicians, pathologists, radiologists and oncologists - through the creation of multidisciplinary teams. The ultimate goal is for people to receive accurate, timely diagnosis of the disease and appropriate selection for treatment.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
SPHERE now operates in 13 countries in Asia-Pacific: Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
In 2015, close to 8,820 pathologists, surgeons and technicians participated in the training programme. Over 168,600 women with breast cancer and nearly 74,000 gastric cancer patients have been tested in the SPHERE program.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), diabetes will affect over 500 million people worldwide in 2030. Developing countries will account for more than 76% of diabetics around the world. Africa will experience the world’s largest increase in diabetes between 2010 and 2030. Africa in 2030 will have over 23 million people with diabetes.
Africa is undergoing an epidemiological transition from communicable diseases to chronic noncommunicable diseases. The diabetes pandemic in Africa is due to:
The increasing age of its communities;
The rapid urbanization leading to a change in lifestyle, with a marked increase in sedentary activities, changes in nutrition, and the rapid increase of overweight people and obesity.
Difficulties to manage diabetes in Africa are mostly due to:
Difficult geographical and financial access to diabetes care, such as lack of medicines, consultation and analysis facilities, lack of trained health professionals to manage diabetes;
The lack of prevention programs;
Health systems which are not adapted to managing chronic diseases, and are focusing on priorities such as HIV, Malaria, Tuberculosis.
This leads to few patients having access to treatment, and to screening and information being virtually inexistent.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Sanofi Espoir Foundation partnered with the NGO Santé Diabète in Mali to fight diabetes through actions on the ground in support of the country’s Ministry of Health and local stakeholders. This involves community awareness-raising, training of healthcare professionals, detection and early management of patients, and rehabilitation of those with disabilities.
This program focused on mobilizing Santé Diabète partners in managing diabetes and mobilizing the Sanofi Espoir Foundation with respect to aspects of prevention, with a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder approach. This became a national program thanks to the expansion of the geographical scope of action. The program operated in close partnership with local authorities in seven of Mali’s eight regions, taking an innovative approach to diabetes by developing 5 action lines, guided by a working method to invest in:
Primary prevention to reduce the human and economic burden of the disease’s progression.
Decentralization of care to ensure geographic accessibility for people and high quality support.
Secondary and tertiary ""therapeutic education"" prevention to reduce the burden of complications from diabetes.
Reducing the cost of care to ensure geographic accessibility of people to high quality support.
An integrated approach including the active involvement of patients and their families through their associations by promoting self-management and advocacy so they can defend their rights.
Lessons learned
The program was led and tracked closely with the National Board of Health (NCD Section) and various Mali government structures associated with preventing and managing diabetes.
Simultaneously, this approach was strengthened by the creation of an extensive network of partners in the north (research centers, universities, patient organizations, international experts, etc.)
The program is a key example showing that close cooperation between the government and NGOs in setting up aid actions can:
Strengthen the local authority mobilization against diabetes;
Strengthen donor mobilization;
Mobilize a large network of international partners to support the fight against diabetes;
But above all, achieve large-scale solid progress for patients.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2012, 409 children benefited from awareness action and 12,000 diabetics received a medical support and access to care.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
More than a year after the adoption of Recommendation 202 on national social protection floors by the International Labor Conference on June 14, 2012, and the resolution on universal health coverage by the United Nations on December 12, 2012, these two issues have emerged as key agenda items for post-2015 development, currently under discussion.
It therefore seems vital for Samusocial International to highlight the issue of including people without resources, and especially those suffering from social exclusion, in national strategies for universal health coverage.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The proposed project aims first to implement an integrated and coordinated approach for access to care for people in extremely vulnerable circumstances in Peru and Mali, and second, to identify best practices in this sector on the basis of these two Samusocial organizations as well as other Samusocial organizations and share them across its network so that they can be effectively replicated.
The first thrust of the project is to step up access to basic health care and education health activities, including a sexual and reproductive health component, among street children and adolescents, marginalized families, victims of domestic violence, and adolescents at risk of early pregnancy, in two different national contexts - Mali and Peru. Drawing on these two experiments, the project aims to create a fundamental Samusocial reference framework for medical services that can be shared with other Samusocial partners across the International network.
The second thrust of the project, drawing on the examples of Mali and Peru, is to strengthen the referring of recipients of Samusocial services to health facilities that form part of the local health system, so that there is a seamless health management link between people coming from Samusocial’s basic medical service and national health services that can offer more complex treatment, especially in the field of preventive, and sexual and reproductive healthcare.
The third and final thrust of the project is to identify good practices and ultimately produce recommendations that will factor the issue of destitute people into national discussions about establishing universal health coverage systems. These recommendations will be shared with all Samusocial organizations and enable Samusocial International to position itself in global, regional and national debates about social protection floors and universal health coverage.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
800 street children and young people will be aided annually by Samusocial Mali during the project, including 200 girls and young women.
3,000 people will be aided per year, including 900 girls and young women by Samusocial Perú in the marginalized urban areas of Huaycán and Santa Rosa.
160 health professionals in Mali and Peru will be trained to care for people suffering from social exclusion.
14 Samusocial organizations that are members of the Samusocial International network will benefit from shared knowledge-raising practices and tools developed by this project.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The cancer burden is mounting in sub-Saharan Africa. Cancer kills more people in the region than either malaria or tuberculosis due to late diagnosis and lack of treatment. In 2012, there were an estimated 626,000 new cases of cancer and 447,000 cancer deaths in the region. Deaths from cancer are expected to almost double by 2030 due to aging populations. Patients are almost twice as likely to die of cancer in sub-Saharan Africa than in the United States. The five-year survival rate for women with breast cancer in the United States is 90%, but in Uganda it's just 46%. One of many important barriers to improving cancer care in Africa has been limited access to treatments.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Pfizer is collaborating with the American Cancer Society and the Clinton Health Access Initiative to provide access to critical cancer treatments such as chemotherapies in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Under the agreement, Pfizer will offer competitive prices for eleven high-quality cancer treatments through Government tenders and procurement mechanisms. Nine of the eleven medicines are on the World Health Organizations’ Essential Medicine List (EML) and are part of the treatment regimens for some of the most common cancers in sub-Saharan Africa including breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. In addition, American oncologists will simplify complex cancer-treatment guidelines for underequipped African hospitals, and IBM programmers will build those guidelines into an online tool available to any oncologist with an internet connection. This initiative is part of Pfizer's broader commitment to strengthen health systems, expand access to medicines and find sustainable solutions to critical medical needs in Africa.

However, expertise in oncology is lacking in the country’s vast rural area, which covers some 2.5 million square kilometres. Health services are usually provided by general practitioners, family advisers or gynaecology-obstetrics units. Consequently, many cancer patients living in rural or remote areas die without being diagnosed, or they are referred to a cancer center in a major city with late-stage disease.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Project Outreach is an initiative between Roche, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, key opinion leaders and national cancer associations, such as the Saudi Cancer Society. Started in 2013, the project aims to ensure that people living in remote areas are properly diagnosed and referred to specialists early enough to receive treatment.
The project includes a dedicated team of eight medical educators who travel remote areas of Saudi Arabia. The team’s role is to raise awareness of cancer, improve screening by local healthcare workers and provide referral information regarding cancer treating physicians in major cities. The project also helped support the opening of a new breast cancer clinic in the main hospital in Bisha.
In 2015, the project carried out 44 educational activities and 46 awareness campaigns. Furthermore, 16,709 women were screened and 163 positive cases were identified and the women were referred to centres to receive treatment.
Project Outreach activities have included organising a breast cancer symposium for primary care physicians in Madinah, where physicians were briefed on the fundamentals of cancer diagnosis, surgical treatment and chemotherapy by specialists from Saudi Arabia’s leading hospitals.
Roche also worked in collaboration with The Saudi Cancer Foundation, launching the “Cancer Care for Primary Care” handbook, which was written by local oncologists and distributed to primary care physicians as a reference and resource to be used on a daily basis.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the National data, the prevalance of diabetes in Himachal Pradesh is 4.3 per cent which is high. If the condition is not managed effectively diabetes can lead to severe and costly complications, including cardiovascular disease, renal failure and blindness. 
The project was conducted in Shimla and Solan Districts of Himachal Pradesh, a hilly terrain in Northern India. 
Around 90 per cent of the people residing in the hilly and difficult terrains of Himachal Pradesh do not have access to health services. Average distance travelled by one health worker per day also varies from 15 meters to 2 kms in inaccessible and accessible areas. Energy spent per day to perform house visit is also comparatively more in hilly terrain as compared to plain areas. 
The hilly terrain creates challenge for the rural population to access the health care services and therefore people need to be given health information that comes handy and easy to understand. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
The project aimed at generating awareness on diabetes through a mobile app. Self management of conditions and awareness on diabetes through a mobile app plays a key role. Given the reach of mobile networks and connected services, mHealth solutions can play a vital role in primary prevention of diabetes and continuous monitoring of disease trends. 
Diab Info is a need based mobile app developed for the community utilizes text and video content to provide information and promote diabetes self-management skills without complex navigation. It helps to create a daily track of their own health records like blood glucose level, medicines, physical activity etc. Behavioural indicators for diabetes were also a part of the app such as diet patterns, quitting alcohol and tobacco. 
Activities done in the community to introduce the mobile health app, its visibility and use 
Content development of mobile app and IVRS was done based on the result of the Need assessment. Side wise a call center was established to provide one to one support about the right knowledge about availability of service as well as facilitate for fixing appointment for visit to health facility.
Validation of content was done in a concentration population.
Advocacy with key stake holder from health, education and youth was done in a regular manner to promote the app and its use.
Orientation and sensitization of stakeholders from three departments, viz.  Health, Education, and Youth Affairs was done.
Promotional Activities were carried out time to time to promote and popularize the use of app and IVRS system.
Regular Feedback mechanism from stake holders and end user were taken for continuous improvement in user-friendliness of the technology as well as the content.
The beneficiaries after downloading and installing the app could view their status and learn on diabetes. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
A cross-sectional quantitative household survey was undertaken among 834 men and women of 10-44 years age group. 48.4 % found the app is useful in behaviour change like daily physical activities and 53.6% found the app useful in controlling the diet. In the case of early detection and symptoms of diabetes, more than 56% respondents replied that the application will benefit the user. 
52.4% have found the app useful in understanding the preventive measures of diabetes and 49.5% found it easy to tell if they are at risk for diabetes. About 45% of individuals have found that the application makes the individual easy to understand about management of the disease. 
The Diab Info application has been installed (offline and online) in 467 devices including 227 downloads from Google Play Store.
Conclusion
mHealth initiative has been proven a potential empowerment tool for self management of diabetes and of significant value in hilly region of the country. 
Diab Info app was developed for the community and it is a need based app. The information provided by the community has been included in the app and, this particular phenomenon has led to the acceptance and success of mobile health technology. 
The project was facilitated by IT experts and it added significant value in providing training and convincing the enabling user.
Effective training of the users and integration of the health systems is required at every step so that the app is used to achieve the desired objectives to access health services.

The Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) was established in 1994 as a not-for-profit US scientific organization to develop vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics for a range of diseases of the developing world.
Buruli Ulcer: IDRI scientists are interested in leveraging expertise in mycobacterial diseases (diseases from the same family of bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy) to assist members of the Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative (GBUI) and BU research community;
HIV/AIDS: The Infectious Diseases Research Institute (IDRI) has been a partner in the MSD Fellowship for Global Health.  The MSD Fellowship for Global Health is three-month, field-based corporate pro bono program designed to leverage the skills and talents of MSD employees worldwide.  MSD Fellows worked with IDRI on developing a global stakeholder engagement strategy and addressing issues associated with HIV R&D as part of the HIV Cure Initiative, and developed a strategic plan for production and commercialization of vaccines and bio therapeutics in African countries.
Chagas: IDRI's research on Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, has emphasized diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutics to treat Chagas disease. In collaboration with GSK, IDRI scientists have developed an effective blood test for Chagas disease, which is now being used in South America;
Leishmaniasis: In March 2000, IDRI received a USD 15 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to fund development of a leishmaniasis vaccine. IDRI, working with GSK, developed the world's first defined vaccine candidate for leishmaniasis, which has been tested in the USA, Peru, Brazil and Colombia, and is currently being tested in India, Sudan, and Venezuela. IDRI has one diagnostic test for leishmaniasis which has US FDA approval and is now used extensively in India. It is working on another, for canine leishmaniasis, with Fiocruz in Brazil;
Leprosy: In a partnership with the American Leprosy Missions, IDRI has embarked on an aggressive program to develop an effective vaccine and better diagnostic tests for leprosy;
Malaria: Using its adjuvant and formulation capabilities, IDRI has joined forces with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative and others in the global effort develop a safe and effective malaria vaccine;
Tuberculosis: IDRI's research efforts to fight tuberculosis encompass vaccine discovery, drug discovery and diagnostics, including work with the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation. In 2016, Lilly extended its long-term IDRI collaboration with a new $15 million commitment. This is intended to accelerate early-stage drug discovery and preclinical development for potential new TB medicines.
Zika: IDRI scientists were given a two-year grant in October 2016 to develop a safe and effective Zika vaccine. IDRI scientists will create a new RNA-based vaccine for candidates with the Zika virus.
IDRI currently has 14 vaccines in clinical trials and over 500,000 compounds have been screened for drugs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Four million health care workers are needed to fill the gap in developing countries—not only specialists such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and lab technicians—but also health care management and support workers.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2004, Pfizer, Accordia Global Health Foundation, Makerere University, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pangaea Global AIDS Foundation and other organizations partnered to establish the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) within the Makerere University of Uganda to improve health in Africa by training medical professionals and providing them with skills and resources to use in their communities. The IDI built its research capacity in Africa by pairing promising new investigators with established researchers from North America and Europe, and through mentoring arrangements and fellowships.
By enhancing the stature and recognition of the Faculty of Medicine at Makerere University, Pfizer's support of the IDI helped to reverse the trend of African healthcare professionals pursuing career opportunities abroad. African doctors, medical scientists, and other healthcare professionals can now pursue their clinical interests in a world-class academic medical setting and serve their home countries and people.
The partnership has had an important contribution in supporting the establishment of different IDI clinics to tackle existing or emerging, but unaddressed health issues affecting the Ugandan society.
An integrated HIV/TB Clinic was formed in late 2009. In the first year alone, more than 2,500 patients were screened for TB and approximately 240 patients have been diagnosed with TB and started on treatment.
In 2008, a Transitional Clinic for adolescents and young adults aged 16-24 was instituted to meet the unique challenges of this population group, whose needs were formerly unmet in either the paediatric unit or the adult clinic. To date, 480 young people have been registered, and are offered excellent clinical care and specialized psycho-social support. The Transition clinic held weekly peer support meetings, skills-building, IEC materials and outreach through drama by members.
Based on studies in Uganda showing a shift in the way HIV is spread, a Discordant Couple’s Clinic was also established to provide specialized clinical care using positive prevention techniques (prevention efforts directed towards individuals living with HIV), peer support meetings, and IEC materials.
Lessons learned
Through the diversification of IDI’s clinics, there are several lessons learned as well as opportunity to continue to research to improve on these specialized services.
A TB working group was formed to focus on improving TB/HIV care for patients at IDI, standardize TB prevention, diagnosis and follow-up procedures, and increase involvement of medical officers in TB management. There are many opportunities for research, specialized training in TB/HIV co-infection and collaborative activities in this field.
Adolescents and young adults infected with HIV face many challenges. One of the most significant is frequent lack of financial stability—since the majority of them have dropped out of school and need support to secure their financial independence. The Transition Clinic is a new model of care that has dramatically changed the lives of a number of young adults. The institute is exploring the potential for increasing the capacity of this specialised clinic and exporting this model of care to other service providers within Uganda. Efforts are being made to support the skill and entrepreneurial development among HIV-positive youth, which will go a long way in improving the welfare of these young people.
The theories on causes of discordance in sub-Saharan Africa are not yet properly understood, and there is a need for additional research on this topic.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
Since 2004, the IDI has trained over 6,800 healthcare providers trained in HIV, malaria, clinical pharmacology, research and systems strengthening from 27 African countries. IDI-trained workers indicate they have trained, on average 20 additional healthcare workers per month. IDI provides quality care and treatment to over 37,000 patients with outreach to 376,000 individuals.
The Institute also publishes research publications, abstracts and research projects, with the goal of improving regional healthcare policy and practice and developing new generation of independent African researchers. IDI and Academic Alliance members also mentor Masters and PhD students.
The partnership reinforced IDI as a well-established institution; internationally recognized for building the capacity of health systems in Africa for the delivery of sustainable, high quality care and prevention of HIV/AIDS and related infectious diseases through training, research and advanced clinical services. It is an integral part of the Ugandan health system. IDI serves as a model for a sustainable, locally- owned, regional Center of Excellence that is transforming the quality of care across the continent.
In 2013, a West African Infectious Diseases Institute (WAIDI) established in Abuja, Nigeria as a multi?institutional center of excellence for advanced research and training. 
Although 2012 marked the end of Pfizer’s operational support in the short term, Pfizer partners with the IDI and WAIDI through Pfizer’s Global Health Fellows program.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Influenza occurs annually, causing significant amount of disease and death, particularly in the elderly, young children and those with certain chronic conditions.
The most common symptoms of the disease are chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness/fatigue and general discomfort. Although it is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses, especially the common cold, influenza is a more severe disease than the common cold and is caused by a different type of virus. Influenza can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death.
Influenza vaccines have been providing good levels of protection for more than 50 years. However, influenza vaccine production is highly complex and involves a large number of steps.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi Pasteur has partnered with the Butantan Institute in Brazil since 1999 to deliver seasonal influenza vaccines to the Brazilian Government, with the possibility of switching to pandemic vaccine production if needed. Based on this agreement, Butantan has developed the ability to produce influenza vaccines locally and now provides doses to fulfill most of their public market needs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Lack of adequate access to primary healthcare affects people worldwide, especially women, newborn babies and children. For example in Mali, the maternal mortality rate stands at 368 in 100,000 live births while 128 children out of 1,000 die before the age of five.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development   uses an access to healthcare framework, defined as the degree to which a healthcare system’s services and providers (supply) are aligned with a patient’s resources, needs and expectations (demand). Access to healthcare and medicines can only be sustainable if the local healthcare system and services meet demand.
Drawing on this framework, the Novartis Foundation has implemented the Initiative Accès from 2008 to 2013, aiming to improve access to primary healthcare specifically for women and children in rural Mali, covering a total of 200,000 people in 210 villages in the region of Ségou.
The Initiative Accès intervened on both the supply and the demand side of access, improving the quality of care through training and supportive supervision, and facilitating financial access for people by supporting women saving groups and community-based health insurance schemes. 
Lessons learned                            
The project showed that by intervening on both the supply and the demand side, access to primary healthcare can be improved for people in rural Mali. Through the Initiative Accès, the availability and accessibility of health services were improved and financial access for patients was facilitated through health insurance and women saving groups. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Through the Initiative Accès, the quality of care as well as the management of health facilities has been improved. For example, 96% of malaria case management were adequate in 2013 compared to 67% in 2008. In the same period, the utilization rate of health facilities in the intervention zone has increased from 0.22 to 0.36.
Based on the lessons learned of the Initiative Accès, the Novartis Foundation is currently working with local partners to develop a new program focusing on innovative solutions to improving maternal, newborn and child health.

            Program Objectives
The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is Europe's largest public-private initiative aiming to speed up the development of better and safer medicines for patients. The IMI2 program aims to increase the success rate of clinical trials of new vaccines, improve drug development process and develop new therapies where there is limited market incentive, such as antimicrobial resistance.

                        

            

            

            What are the health needs and challenges?
New and innovative treatments are needed to tackle Europe’s growing health challenges. Where there is medical, social or public health need, the development of innovative medicines must be fast in order to meet demands. By collaborating with healthcare researchers, universities, pharmaceutical industries, SMEs and medicine regulators these challenges can be tackled and new treatments developed.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
IMI supports collaborative research projects and builds networks of industrial and academic experts in order to boost pharmaceutical innovation in Europe. The Initiative is a joint undertaking between the European Union and the pharmaceutical industry association EFPIA. In 2016, there are over 7000 researchers across different sectors involved who work on open collaboration, improved R&D productivity and innovative approaches.
IMI was launched in 2008 and currently has over 70 projects. Some focus on specific health issues such as neurological conditions, and others focus on broader challenges such as the sustainability of chemical drug production.
In 2011, the European Commission called for unprecedented collaborative research and development efforts to bring new antibiotics to patients. Consequently, a specific IMI program to research new antibiotics was launched. The result was the New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) program.
One project within the ND4BB programme is COMBACTE-CARE, a study and clinical trial of a novel antibiotic designed to tackle drug-resistant infections. The aim of the trial is to assess the safety and workings of the antibiotic in 40 patients with ‘complicated intra-abdominal infections’. The project focuses on tackling bacteria called CRE, which is resistant to most antibiotics and consequently there are limited or no treatments.

GlaxoSmithKline has been involved with Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), a strategy developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF since 1996 when it initiated an unique partnership with the South African Ministry of Health. Since then, GSK has entered into public-private partnership agreements with WHO, UNICEF, National Ministries of Health and/or NGOs for the implementation of the IMCI strategy or components thereof in Ethiopia, Namibia, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya.IMCI aims to reduce morbidity and mortality due to the major killer diseases for children under five: malaria, diarrhea, malnutrition, measles, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS and neonatal causes. The strategy includes three main components: 1) improving the case management skills of health workers; 2) strengthening the health system; and 3) improving key household and community practices that have the greatest impact on child survival.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
ETHIOPIAThe health status of Ethiopians (population approximately 65 million) is among the lowest in the world with health service coverage at 50.4%. The Ministry of Health of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia endorsed IMCI as the main strategy to reduce the unacceptably high under five mortality - 140 per 1000 live births (FMOH, 2002/2003 Dabat and Wukro Districts were selected from Amhara and Tigray regions respectively for piloting c-IMCI implementation in the country. Based on the encouraging results from the two pilot districts in Amhara and Tigray regions, further expansion has taken place to Benishangul-Gumuz and Oromiya regions.GHANAWHO, Ghana Health Service and GSK signed a tri-partite agreement to improve the care and management of children less than five years of age at community levels (thereby improving under-five morbidity and mortality in the long term) in 12 districts. Specific objectives: to improve the knowledge and practices of families and communities; to provide caregivers of infants and young children with knowledge on appropriate feeding of their infants and children and to improve the feeding practices and growth of infants and children in selected communities; and to provide community members with health information and education to improve the care of infants and children. Benefits of the programme include improved relationship between volunteers and community members, provision of structures for growth promotion sessions beyond the financial capacities of communities and “health care to the door step of the people”. Implementation of the project started in January 2005.NAMIBIAUnder the Government Republic of Namibia-UNICEF Young Children Health Care and Development Program, GlaxoSmithKline has been supporting the implementation of all 3 components of IMCI (mainly c-IMCI) in six districts (Windhoek, Omaruru, Mariental, Opuwo, Katima Mulilo and Engela) – with infant and under-five mortality rates of 52 and 71 per 1000 live births respectively.NIGERIANigeria has a population of approximately 140 million – the largest in sub-Saharan Africa – with 43.4% under the age of 14 years. The under-5 mortality rate is 184 per 1000 live births.
In May 2003 GSK signed a tripartite partnership agreement with the Federal Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization to support efforts to improve child health in Nigeria through the implementation of c-IMCI in the Karu Local Government Area in the middle belt of Nigeria – estimated population of 300,000.
SOUTH AFRICAGSK has been involved, both financially and through the sharing of expertise, with the implementation of all three components of IMCI in eight of the nine provinces between 1996 and 2001. In partnership with World Vision, UNICEF and the provincial department of Health, GSK also supported the development of a specific model for the implementation of the Community Component of IMCI in the Bergville area of KwaZulu-Natal – a model which has since then been utilized by many other countries within SSA for the implementation of c-IMCI.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
To date, 1,626 health professionals and 9,087 community resource persons have been trained in key household and community practices and more than 450,000 households have already been reached by them. To date 10,000 children have been registered in the communities for nutrition and growth promotion activities, 155 health workers and 355 volunteers trained respectively in the districts since the implementation of the partnership project.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
More than 36 million people have died due to AIDS-related causes since the pandemic began and millions more are newly infected with the virus each year. Global efforts to battle the pandemic are making a significant difference; still, AIDS remains the sixth leading cause of death in low-income countries, according to the World Health Organization. The most vulnerable and impoverished people in the world continue to bear the heaviest burden of this merciless disease: sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 70% of new HIV infections in 2012.
The best long-term solution to the growing global AIDS epidemic is a vaccine, which does not yet exist.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) was created in 1996 out of recognition that the best long-term solution to the growing AIDS epidemic was a vaccine. As a global organization operating across borders to meet the challenges posed by the epidemic, IAVI works to ensure the development of safe, effective, accessible and preventive HIV vaccines for use throughout the world. IAVI's work focuses on four areas:
Support through advocacy and education (by identifying and filling other scientific gaps);
Scientific progress (by supporting promising vaccine development partnerships);
Industrial participation in AIDS vaccine development (by expanding public-private collaboration and creating incentives for private sector investment and participation in HIV vaccine development); and
Global access (by creating the policies necessary for getting the vaccines to all those who need it).
The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) works with its partners to ensure the development of safe, effective, accessible and preventive HIV vaccines for use throughout the world.
IAVI‘s scientific team works with more than 50 academic, commercial and government institutions to develop and assess candidate HIV vaccines. IAVI has partnered with local research institutions to develop a network of sophisticated laboratories in India and in southern and eastern Africa. IAVI also has brought leading HIV researchers together into scientific consortia, including the Neutralizing Antibody Consortium and the Vectors Consortium, to address key obstacles to the development of an effective AIDS vaccine and to generate novel candidates.
Uniquely positioned to rapidly move novel vaccine candidates from the academic bench to clinical testing in the developing world, IAVI’s success comes in part from an end-to-end network of 10 collaborating clinical research centers in Africa, in-house research laboratories and external academic, government and industry collaborators. In developing countries, IAVI works closely with governmental, community and civic organizations to ensure the transparent and ethical conduct of clinical trials. IAVI helps educate people about vaccine trials and the need for AIDS vaccines and also helps build both the clinical and scientific capacity required to run a long-term program of vaccine trials.
IAVI also analyzes and develops policies to promote the involvement of the private sector in AIDS vaccine research and development, advocating for policies that will ensure that once an AIDS vaccine is developed, it will be swiftly produced, distributed and made affordable worldwide.IAVI conducts leading-edge vaccine science with top laboratories around the world and harnesses innovation from within and beyond the HIV vaccine field to introduce new tools, technologies and concepts to change the arc of AIDS vaccine science.
In 2005, GlaxoSmithKline launched the first formal public-private partnership with IAVI to research vaccines against HIV strains that circulate predominantly in Africa. IAVI and GSK contributed technical, preclinical and clinical expertise and shared funding; researchers from both groups formed a joint project team. They evaluated the combination of two vaccine candidates (the F4/AS01 adjuvanted protein developed by GSK and the Adenovirus 35-GRIN vaccine developed by IAVI) up to Phase I clinical trial in which long term follow-up is currently ongoing. 
Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and  IAVI entered into an agreement to develop an HIV vaccine based on the company's AdVac adenovirus vector technology and obtained the rights from J&J to use a cell line for these vectors. A Phase I clinical trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of a candidate vaccine based on this technology started in 2009.
In August 2010 Janssen and IAVI announced their participation in an international Phase I clinical trial in the United States and Africa of a combination of two Ad-based AIDS vaccine candidates, Ad26.ENVA.01 and Ad35-ENV, in healthy adults who are not infected with HIV. The clinical trial, led by IAVI has started in October 2010, representing a collaboration between IAVI, Janssen, the Ragon Institute, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.
Lessons learned              
Perhaps the most critical roadblock to the development of an effective AIDS vaccine arises from HIV’s uncanny ability to avoid neutralization by antibodies. However, a handful of antibodies capable of shutting down the many variants of the virus have been isolated from HIV-infected individuals.
Work done within IAVI’s Neutralizing Antibody Consortium (NAC) has since exposed not only how each of the known neutralizing antibodies manages to shut down HIV, but also how the virus shields its vulnerable spots from immune attack. This information is now being harnessed by NAC scientists to devise new approaches to developing AIDS vaccine candidates.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Researchers and policymakers are today increasingly convinced that an AIDS vaccine is possible and could help significantly slow the spread of HIV. Scientists have isolated and closely analyzed dozens of exceptionally potent antibodies that neutralize a broad spectrum of HIV variants circulating around the world.
To date, some 30 AIDS vaccine clinical trials are ongoing, predominantly in early stages (Phases I and II).

            What are the health needs and challenges?
HIV/AIDS is one of the world’s most serious and immediate threats to women’s health and has claimed more than 36 million lives worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 75 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 36 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 35.3 million [32.2–38.8 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2012. An estimated 0.8% of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 20 adults living with HIV and accounting for 71% of the people living with HIV worldwide.
Vaginal microbicides are topical products being developed to prevent heterosexual transmission of HIV. Microbicides could take many forms, including those that could be used monthly or daily, or at or around the time of intercourse.
Researchers at the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) are developing a variety of products that include daily vaginal gels, films and tablets, as well as vaginal rings that would release an ARV drug gradually and provide protection against HIV for as much as a month at a time.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
IPM provides women with affordable and self-initiated HIV-prevention strategies to reduce HIV transmission and is developing microbicides based on existing antiretroviral (ARV) drugs being used to successfully treat HIV/AIDS and prevent mother-to-child transmission.
IPM receives non-royalty-bearing, non-exclusive licenses from companies to develop, manufacture and distribute novel ARV compounds for use as a vaginal microbicides in developing countries to help protect women from HIV. Some of the compounds, such as members of a class of ARV molecules known as fusion inhibitors, inhibit HIV infection by preventing the virus from fusing with the surface of target cells, which is an early step in the HIV infection process. These compounds may offer a novel way of blocking infections.
IPM focuses on preventing HIV transmission by accelerating the development and availability of safe and effective microbicides and other HIV prevention methods for use by women in developing countries.
Janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, established one of the very first public-private partnerships in the microbicides field with IPM in 2004, providing royalty-free licensing and technology transfer to develop, manufacture and commercialize dapivirine (TMC120) as a vaginal microbicide to reduce sexual transmission of HIV in resource-poor countries. In 2014, Janssen expanded this collaboration, granting IPM exclusive worldwide rights for dapivirine alone or in combination with either microbicidal antiretroviral medicines and/or in combination with contraceptives.  IPM’s monthly vaginal microbicidal ring with dapivirine – potentially the first product of its kind – is now being studied in two parallel efficacy trials in multiple African countries with results expected in late 2015. IPM is also developing a 90-day ring that combines dapivirine with a contraceptive, which is set to enter clinical testing in 2015.
In October 2005, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it had granted a royalty-free license to IPM to develop, manufacture and distribute two new antiretroviral compounds as vaginal microbicides to protect women from HIV in resource poor countries. The compounds are HIV attachment inhibitors which bind directly to the HIV itself and prevent the virus attachment to the host cell receptor. The compounds are designed to prevent HIV from entering host cells, thus preventing infection.
MSD granted  IPM a non-royalty-bearing, nonexclusive license to develop, manufacture and distribute a novel ARV compound for use as a vaginal microbicide to help protect women in developing countries. The compound, the fourth we have licensed to IPM, is a member of a class of ARV molecules known as fusion inhibitors, which inhibit HIV infection by preventing the virus from fusing with the surface of the target cells – an early step in the HIV process – potentially representing a novel way to block infection. Merck is also collaborating with Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedures Documents to advance early-stage product development research efforts. 
IPM works with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, philanthropic foundations, local research centers in developing countries, civil society organizations and academic institutions to evaluate promising compounds, design optimal formulations, conduct preclinical and clinical trials, identify appropriate regulatory pathways for products and establish manufacturing and distribution capacity to ensure access to future products.
Lessons learned
The promise that microbicides represent will be realized only if women can obtain these products easily and affordably, and will use them effectively once they are available.
Ensuring access to drugs in developing countries can be highly challenging because of weak health systems and a lack of skilled health workers and financing. New drugs have historically been designed and developed for industrialized markets, and introduced into developing countries only several years later, if at all.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Findings from the first clinical trial of an ARV-based microbicide announced in July 2010 offer new cause for optimism. The trial, called CAPRISA 004, demonstrated proof-of-concept that an ARV-based microbicide can prevent women from becoming infected with HIV through sex with an infected male partner. Conducted in South Africa among 889 women, the CAPRISA trial found a 39 percent lower HIV infection rate in women using 1% tenofovir gel as compared to those women using a placebo gel. Dozens of potential drugs that interrupt HIV transmission or replication are currently being studied as possible microbicide candidates.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Trachoma is an infectious eye disease that causes eyelids to turn in and lashes to scrape the eyeball, causing great pain, corneal ulcers and irreversible blindness unless treated with antibiotics or a simple surgical procedure. Trachoma affects the poorest of the poor and nearly 163 million people are living in trachoma-endemic areas in 58 countries. 
Trachoma is treatable and preventable with full implementation of the WHO recommended SAFE strategy:
Surgery for inturned eyelashes/eyelids.
Antibiotics to treat and prevent active infection.
Facial cleanliness to prevent disease transmission.
Environmental change to increase access to water and sanitation.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Pfizer, through the ITI, is partnering with a number of global health organizations working to eliminate trachoma. They include: governments, UN Agencies, The World Health Organization, USAID, Department for International Development (DFID), The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Carter Center, CBM, The Fred Hollows Foundation, Helen Keller International, The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology, Light for the World, Lions Club International, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Organisation pour la Prévention de la Cécité, Orbis, The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, RTI International, Sightsavers, The Task Force for Global Health, Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins, and World Vision. 
Lessons learned 
The International Coalition of Trachoma Control (ICTC) supports efforts to eliminate trachoma aligned with the WHO GET2020 Alliance's 2016 plan of action Eliminating Trachoma: Accelerating Towards 2020, which outlines what needs to be done to scale up programs and strengthen health systems to achieve the global elimination of trachoma by the year 2020. 
This builds on earlier action plans: The end in sight: 2020 INSight, ICTC's 2011 trachoma elimination roadmap, and WHO's 2011 Accelerating work to overcome the global impact of neglected tropical diseases - a roadmap for implementation, a comprehensive plan of control, elimination and eradication targets for 17 NTDs to be reached between 2012-2020. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
To date, through the ITI, Pfizer has donated 740 million doses of its antibiotic.
Since the start of the program in 1998, more than a hundred million people in 33 countries have been treated.
Oman, Morocco, Mexico, Cambodia and Lao PDR have achieved validation of elimination by WHO.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of tropical infections caused by virus, bacteria or parasites that are especially endemic in low-income populations in developing countries. It is estimated that more than 1 billion people are affected by NTDs.
Globally, there are an estimated 12 million patients affected by leishmaniasis, 8 million affected by Chagas disease and 300,000 patients living with human African trypanosomiasis for which there are no effective treatments. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The iNTRODB was created as a part of the collaborative research between six institutes in Japan and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), a non-profit drug research and development organization. It is the world’s first integrated database for NTDs Drug-discovery research.
This drug-discovery research targets four NTDs: leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), which are in most need for effective new medicines among NTDs, and dengue fever which has high unmet medical needs. 
The iNTRODB includes information on all protein-coding genes in genomes of three trypanosome species which cause Leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease and African trypanosomiasis. It helps researchers to identify and choose promising drug target proteins by providing various information including protein structure, potential inhibitors, and experimental assay results. Every researcher can freely use this database and therefore the iNTRODB can accelerate drug discovery research for NTDs across the world.
The database has been built on the basis of the supercomputers and expertise in information technology at Tokyo Tech, the genetic and biological data and knowledge about protozoa at the University of Tokyo, and the knowledge and expertise on drug discovery and research at Astellas.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
iNTRODB is highly regarded as an example of how close cooperation among Japanese research institutes and international NPOs can contribute to solving problems on a global scale, and it received the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare Award of the 11th annual Merit Awards for Industry-Academia-Government Collaboration in August 2013.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Antimicrobial resistance – and specifically that seen in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) – is one of the world’s most serious public health threats. MDR-TB is resistant to at least two of the four most commonly used medicines in today’s standard treatment regimen. Despite the development of new MDR-TB treatment options, the ability to scale up the appropriate use of treatment regimens remains very challenging given weak health care infrastructures, which typically exist in vulnerable countries. However, in order to prevent further resistance, it is essential to ensure responsible access to new treatment options in these countries, including accurate diagnosis and documentation of use and impact.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In March 2015, J&J and USAID formalized a collaboration that leverages the expertise and capabilities of two of the largest private and public organizations engaged in the global TB effort to implement a responsible introduction of J&J anti-MDR TB treatment in more than 100 countries. J&J will contribute up to 30,000 treatments of its anti-TB treatment valued at $30 million USD, to USAID’s global system-strengthening, data collection, and medical educational efforts. In January 2016, Johnson & Johnson announced a $15-20 million pledge as part of a new partnership with USAID to combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Since the launch of the J&J/USAID donation program in April of 2015, 38 countries have reached out to the Global Drug Facility to access anti-MDR-TB treatment through the donation program. J&J, USAID, and its partners are engaging with National TB programs to build systems, infrastructure and competencies to ensure appropriate patient identification, optimize treatment regimens, and bolster patient monitoring and pharmacovigilance.

Its objective is to foster the sustainable management of the Jaborandi tree, a plant which is needed by Boehringer Ingelheim’s Phytochemicals department to obtain pilocarpin, the active ingredient of a medication used for the treatment of glaucoma.
Through training and certification of farmers and the organisation of local cooperatives, the initiative supports traditional rural communities in promoting the sustainable wild collection of the leaves, the collaboration of farmers across communities and independent management of the sourcing activities. In addition to this, all workers are identified and ensured fair compensation, thereby generating a fair income, enabling them to afford education and healthcare for their families.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Five communities in different regions of North and Northeast Brazil have been developed so far. Three of them already implemented a self-sufficient and independent management in 2013.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Providing people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) with first-line HIV medicines is currently a top public health priority for countries with high HIV burdens. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the availability of HIV medicines is expanding at a rapid rate, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson is committed to helping PLWHA through effective and sustainable access to our HIV medicines. As a key element of the new Janssen Global Public Health group, global HIV Medicines Access & Partnerships Program is working to fulfill PLWHA needs in resource-limited settings (RLS).
HIV treatment is a life-long commitment for patients and Janssen access efforts for HIV recognize that commitment for the long-term. Direct agreements with generic manufacturers allow sharing of technical skills and experience as well as ensure not only the availability of generic versions of Janssen’s medicines, but also their safety and quality. Generic manufacturers play an important role in support of a strategy to reduce costs and maintain the affordability of these medicines.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Janssen R&D Ireland (formerly Tibotec Pharmaceuticals) granted multiple non-exclusive licenses to Hetero Drugs, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Strides ArcoLab and Matrix Laboratories of India, and Aspen Pharmacare of South Africa to manufacture, market and distribute generic versions of its non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine hydrochloride (TMC 278), subject to its approval for use with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults. The Indian companies have rights to market the product in 112 lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Aspen has rights to market the product in SSA, including South Africa. These agreements offer licensees the technical information and knowledge (“tech transfer”) to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished product. They also enable the development of appropriate fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of rilpivirine with other HIV medicines within the licensing territories. The generic manufacturers will be responsible for timely regulatory filing for generic rilpivirine and for seeking pre-qualification from the World Health Organization (WHO) and FDA ANDA generic drug approvals.
How challenges are addressed by the partnership activities
A comprehensive multi-country branded registration effort is necessary to ensure timely availability of both branded and generic medicines. The HIV Medicines Access & Partnerships Program has prioritized registration efforts in those countries with greatest HIV burden and economic vulnerability. EDURANT™ received its first regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe in 2011. This is an important first step, as many resource-limited countries require EMA and/or FDA approval documentation to submit local regulatory dossiers. Regulatory filings for branded EDURANT™ are ongoing worldwide, including in RLS. In December 2013, EDURANT™ was approved in South Africa—its first regulatory approval in SSA.
After a drug receives regulatory approval, ongoing clinical research continues to provide invaluable insights on the most effective use of new medicines. Janssen supports or conducts clinical research on the appropriate and safe use of our approved HIV medicines in RLS. Janssen is currently supporting the Switching At Low HIV-1 RNA Into Fixed Dose Combinations (SALIF) study, which will help further determine the appropriate clinical positioning of rilpivirine in RLS. Patients with higher viral loads (VL >100,000 copies/mL) are less likely to achieve viral suppression with rilpivirine, which is a concern in RLS where viral load testing, especially prior to treatment initiation, is not often available. SALIF will explore rilpivirine as a potential “switch” option once a viral load of <50 copies/mL is reached. This study is an important first step in efforts to ensure the safe and appropriate use of rilpivirine in resource-limited settings. SALIF is a multicenter, multi-country, open-label study that will take place at 28 sites in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Senegal, Cameroon, and South Africa) and two countries in Asia-Pacific (Thailand and Vietnam). Patient recruitment is underway.
Janssen also regularly seeks input on local treatment barriers, research, guidelines and clinical practice from treatment experts and advocates with wide-ranging expertise across treatment, education, public and private sectors in RLS.       
Lessons learned
Licensing agreements with generic partners to facilitate and ensure sustainable access to generic versions of Janssen’s HIV medicines are an important part of Janssen’s HIV Medicines Access & Partnerships Program. Key considerations of Janssen’s current HIV portfolio – including potential partner interest and the expected clinical demand – have driven the Company’s licensing strategy and influenced the timing of when licenses are issued and the number of licensees for each product.
Although rilpivirine is not yet included in WHO’s treatment guidelines for first- or second-line treatment and currently there is limited clinical demand, Janssen licensed the compound prior to approval in the US and Europe because of its potentially high public health impact. This early involvement of generic manufacturers has helped accelerate the availability of generic versions of rilpivirine within the licensing territory.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
As a result of the early licensing of rilpivirine, generic manufacturers were able to initiate development work for the single agent and fixed dose combination prior to the US FDA and EMEA approval. This will allow Janssen’s licensees to accelerate regulatory filings and the availability of generic versions upon inclusion in WHO and national treatment guidelines.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Tuberculosis (TB), often thought of as a disease of the past, continues to plague the world’s most vulnerable populations. A curable disease, it claims the lives of 1.7 million people each year, according to the WHO. Ninety-eight percent of these deaths occur in the developing world, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development. More than 2 billion people, or roughly one-third of the world’s population, are infected with the microbes that cause TB. Of those infected, one in 10 will become sick with active TB.
The most popular vaccine used to treat TB was developed in the early 20th century using a bovine strain of the disease. Despite widespread use, the vaccine does not always work. It has been shown to protect against severe TB in children, but there is little evidence of effectiveness in adults. Furthermore, it can create a false-positive TB test in those who have been vaccinated.
To cure TB requires a regimen of several medicines that must be taken daily for six to nine months. But many patients fail to complete the treatment, or medication is incorrectly prescribed, which can lead to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and the non-profit Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) share their expertise and resources in the development of TMC207, which could become the first TB drug with a new mechanism of action in 40 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Janssen is developing TMC207 for the treatment of MDR-TB and, on approval, will work with global (Stop TB Partnership, WHO, etc.), regional and local stakeholders to ensure the product is appropriately used in accordance with international standards, affordable and available to patients in need. The agreement grants the TB Alliance a royalty-free license for the worldwide development and access to TMC207 in the field of drug-susceptible TB. Janssen and the TB Alliance will share expertise and resources in the development of TMC207. A number of Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) studies have been conducted to establish dose finding and to facilitate new regimen selection. Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) studies are also underway.
In addition, Janssen collaborates with the TB Alliance in a discovery research program to identify other new compounds for the treatment of TB. The rights for the newly discovered compounds for the treatment of tuberculosis will belong to the TB Alliance under a royalty-free license.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
Dose finding results and results from early bactericidal activity trials, including bedaquiline combinations in patients, have been published and results from the second combination study with bedaquiline were presented at the 2013 stakeholders meeting.  Additional general updates were presented  at the 2013 CPTR meeting.
The discovery research program was extended from 3 to 4 years.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the biggest filovirus outbreak the world has ever seen. More than 28,600 individuals were infected with the virus across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and more than 11,300 people died – including more than 500 healthcare workers. Experts agree that future outbreaks are highly likely. Additionally, the documented persistence of the virus in Ebola survivors adds to the urgency of finding a robust and durable vaccine that produces sustained immunity. Vaccine regimens in development could be vital prevention tools for outbreak response and preparedness, particularly for health workers and other vulnerable populations on the frontlines.
No licensed vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease currently exists.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2014, Johnson & Johnson has mobilized significant resources to accelerate the development of heterologous prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimens, including monovalent and multivalent regimens. Heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens aim to create longer-lasting immunity through the administration of multiple vaccine doses of different kinds over time.
The monovalent program, designed to address the Ebola virus, features a prime-boost vaccine regimen of two vaccine components that are based on AdVac® technology from Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and MVA-BN® technology from Bavarian Nordic. Janssen launched 10 Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies in rapid succession across three continents to evaluate this vaccine regimen, and secured funding from leading sponsors of research in Europe (the Innovative Medicines Initiative) and the US (the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) to support this program.
Johnson & Johnson is also developing a second-generation, multivalent version of the AdVac/MVA-BN vaccine regimen. The multivalent prime-boost regimen is intended to protect against multiple filoviruses that cause disease in humans, including the Ebola, Sudan and Marburg viruses.
Janssen’s investigational Ebola vaccine regimens originate from a collaborative research program with the US National Institutes of Health that began in 2008.
Lessons learned
To be fully prepared for the next major Ebola outbreak, the world will likely need several Ebola vaccines. Different vaccines may offer different advantages. For example, some may be optimized for rapid administration during an emerging outbreak and others for long-term prevention and protection of vulnerable populations such as health workers. Additionally, it will be important to have more than one proven and approved vaccine available to ensure uninterrupted supply and overcome potential manufacturing constraints associated with a specific product.
Many challenges face the successful development and deployment of an Ebola vaccine, especially in resource-limited countries. Johnson & Johnson is collaborating with partners to promote awareness, understanding and uptake of new Ebola vaccines in clinical trial settings through communications and community engagement strategies.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Final Phase 1 results from a UK study of the investigational monovalent vaccine regimen were published in March 2017 in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study in healthy volunteers found that the regimen was well-tolerated, and produced an immune response among 100 percent of participants that was sustained 1 year following vaccination. Preliminary data from Phase 1 trials in Africa also suggest that the vaccine regimen elicits a persistent immune response.
In partnership with Bavarian Nordic, Janssen has rapidly scaled up production of the vaccine regimen and currently has approximately 1,800,000 regimens available, with the capacity to produce several million regimens if needed.
In September 2016, Johnson & Johnson completed a submission to the World Health Organization (WHO) for Emergency Use Assessment and Listing (EUAL) for the monovalent prime-boost vaccine regimen. The EUAL is a special procedure that can be implemented where there is an outbreak of a disease with high rates of morbidity or mortality and a lack of approved treatment or prevention options. If the WHO grants EUAL, this will accelerate the availability of Janssen’s investigational vaccine regimen to the international community in the event another Ebola crisis occurs.
Also in September 2016, Janssen began a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical study of its second-generation multivalent vaccine regimen for the Ebola, Sudan and Marburg viruses. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the US National Institutes of Health, is funding the US study to test the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the multivalent Ebola vaccine regimen.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the WHO, over the last three decades, the number of people around the world diagnosed with diabetes has tripled, with Diabetes prevalence rising more rapidly in middle- and low-income countries.
The number of people with type 1 diabetes is increasing around the world and it is currently estimated that around every 6 minutes a young person finds out they have type 1 diabetes.
In addition, although highly prevalent in people aged over 50 years old, the number of cases of type 2 diabetes reported in children and adolescents has increased.
Schools play an important role in protecting the rights of school children with diabetes; however, for many of these children evidence has highlighted that a lack of knowledge within schools around diabetes can lead to poor support, isolation, stigma and discrimination. Equally, education of teachers, children and their parents of the importance a healthy lifestyle can help prevent young people from developing type 2 diabetes.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2010 the Diabetes at School in Turkey program was developed as a joint protocol initiated by the Turkish Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Association in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health. The objectives of the program were to target school communities across Turkey in order to raise awareness about type 1 diabetes, provide better diabetes pediatric care, and improve nutritional standards and eating habits for school children in order to prevent obesity. 
Learning from this experience, Sanofi co-created the KiDS and Diabetes in School (KiDS) project with the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) to raise awareness of diabetes among school children and foster a safe and supportive school environment to support children with this condition, more specifically
For children with type 1: it aims to encourage a safe and supportive school environment for children with diabetes to manage their condition and avoid discrimination;
For all children: it aims to raise awareness of diabetes and the benefits of healthy diets and physical activities among school-age children.
As partners, we have co-created a KiDS toolkit that is currently available in 9 languages and progressively rolled out through educational sessions in schools.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Although half of the world’s population lives in rural areas, only 23% of health workers globally are deployed there. Over one billion people globally lack access to healthcare because they live too far from a doctor or clinic. Last Mile Health ensures access to quality primary health services for those living in remote communities by recruiting, training, equipping, managing and paying professionalized Community Health Workers to serve as formal extensions of the primary health system. Last Mile Health’s CHWs are members of the communities they serve; bringing critical health services to the doorsteps of people living in the worlds’ hardest to reach places. 
In 2014, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history struck West Africa. It would go on to spread to six countries and claim nearly 12,000 lives. Liberia was among the hardest hit nations, suffering nearly 10,100 cases and 5,000 deaths. The crisis struck at the heart of Liberia’s healthcare system, taking the lives of hundreds of health workers and crippling health infrastructure.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Merck has been the first Pharmaceutical partner supportive of Last Mile Health’s Ebola response in Liberia, an organization dedicated to delivering health solutions in the world’s most remote villages. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Good outbreak control relies especially on raising awareness and building capacity in rural healthcare delivery. To prevent the spread of Ebola virus in Liberia, LMH has been leveraging its expertise and tools to continuously and rigorously train community-based providers to administer treatment and provide preventative care. 
Indeed, Ebola preventative and early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment can improve survival.
Last Mile Health recruits, trains, equips, manages and pays professionalized Community Health Workers to provide primary healthcare in the last mile. Community Health Workers are members of the communities they serve, selected by their own leaders to receive training because of their talent, commitment and ability. These motivated women and men become professional healthcare providers who work tirelessly to advance their skills and provide high quality care to their own people.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Last Mile Health’s comprehensive response entailed:
At the community level, ensured the safety and security of all staff while continuing to provide primary health services to communities. With the motto “keep safe, keep serving,” Community Health Workers implemented a ‘no-touch’ policy that enabled them to safely provide essential primary health services throughout the outbreak.
At the clinic level, over 1300 health workers and community members were trained on infection prevention and control (IPC) measures at 38 health facilities across two counties.
At the national level, Last Mile Health seconded staff to support senior officials in the Liberia Ministry of Health throughout the crisis, ensuring that interventions coordinated at the community level were part of a cohesive national response.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, bacteria that multiply very slowly. Once infected, the average incubation period is two to three years, although it can take between 6 months and 40 years for symptoms to appear. Leprosy is not highly infectious and although its transmission is not fully understood, close and frequent contact with an infectious patient accelerates transmission. Leprosy mainly affects the skin and nerves. If untreated, there may be progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2000 Novartis has been providing MDT free of charge to all leprosy patients through the WHO, donating more than 56 million MDT blister packs valued at over USD 90 million, helping to treat over 6 million leprosy patients worldwide. In 2015, as part of its commitment to the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), Novartis announced the extension of this MDT donation through to 2020. This five-year agreement includes treatments worth more than USD 40 million and up to USD 2.5 million to support the WHO in handling the donation and logistics. Overall it is expected that the program will reach an estimated 1.3 million patients during the next five years.
Since 1981, more than 16 million people have been treated for leprosy thanks to MDT, the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), reducing the global burden by 99% - a public health success story. However in recent years, leprosy elimination efforts have become a victim of their own success: with fewer patients detected, funding and political commitment as well as knowledge of the disease has also declined. The case detection rate for leprosy has plateaued at about 200,000–250,000 over the past 10 years, and the disease remains endemic in many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America; even countries with low overall endemicity may have localized high-burden pockets. Approximately 10% newly diagnosed leprosy patients are children, indicating continued transmission of the disease. As a result, the challenge is now how to interrupt transmission of leprosy.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The availability of a global supply of high-quality MDT, free of charge, has helped bring leprosy services closer to affected communities, through general health services rather than specialized clinics. 
The Novartis Foundation has been active in the fight against leprosy for over 25 years. Besides implementing a new strategy toward zero transmission of leprosy, the foundation also facilitates the Novartis MDT donation and convenes leprosy and disease elimination experts and stakeholders at key events, striving to bring new momentum in the last mile in leprosy elimination. 
The Novartis Foundation now focuses on exploring innovative interventions to bring the world closer to the eventual goals of leprosy elimination. The Novartis Foundation also supports:
International leprosy post-exposure prophylaxis (LPEP) program with Erasmus University Medical Center, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and several International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP) members: Netherlands Leprosy Relief, FAIRMED, American Leprosy Missions and the German Leprosy and TB Relief Association, working together with national leprosy control programs to interrupt leprosy transmission by reducing the risk of the development of leprosy among contacts of newly detected patients. LPEP has been launched in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Brazil.
Leprosy Alert and Response Network System (LEARNS), the Philippines’ first mobile phone-based leprosy detection system, allowing frontline healthcare providers to send images of suspect leprosy lesions and symptoms via SMS to a specialist.
Development of a diagnostic test together with the Swiss École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to begin the assay development and preclinical validation of the leprosy molecular diagnostic test, and with Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Brazil to begin work on innovative sampling procedures to aid leprosy detection.

The overall aim of the Leprosy Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (LPEP) program is to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of contact tracing and the provision of preventative treatment for leprosy under routine conditions in several countries, and to determine the impact this has on leprosy incidence. The ultimate goal of the LPEP program is to document and integrate the evidence generated and lessons learned into national leprosy policy to ensure widespread implementation.
The LPEP project has four goals:
The integration of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) experiences and lessons learnt into national leprosy programs.
The development of guidelines for PEP and contact management.
The creation of nationally scalable surveillance systems including active contact tracing and PEP.
The documentation of the cost implication of this new strategy for national leprosy programs.

Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, bacteria that multiply very slowly. Once infected, the average incubation period is two to three years, although it can take between 6 months and 40 years for symptoms to appear. Leprosy is not highly infectious and although its transmission is not fully understood, close and frequent contact with an infectious patient accelerates transmission. Disabilities are secondary complications which result from late diagnosis when the insensitivity (nerve damage) caused by leprosy is already present. Multidrug therapy (MDT), the WHO-recommended treatment, consists of three drugs (dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine), of which the latter two were developed in the research laboratories of Novartis. MDT has made it possible to treat patients, reduce the transmission of leprosy and prevent disabilities. Even patients with the severest form of the disease show visible clinical improvement within weeks of starting treatment.
Since 2000, Novartis has been providing MDT free of charge to all leprosy patients through the WHO, donating more than 56 million blister packs valued at over USD 90 million, helping to treat over 6 million leprosy patients worldwide. In 2015, as part of its commitment to the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), Novartis announced the extension of this MDT donation through to 2020.

Overall it is expected that the program will reach an estimated 1.3 million patients during the next five years.
Since 1981, more than 16 million leprosy patients have been treated thanks to the widespread availability of MDT, reducing the global burden by 95% - a real public health success story. In recent years, however, leprosy elimination efforts have become a victim of their own success: with fewer patients detected, funding and political commitment as well as knowledge of the disease has declined. The case detection rate for leprosy has plateaued at about 200,000–250,000 over the past ten years, and the disease remains endemic in many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America; even countries with low overall endemicity may have localized high-burden pockets. As a result, the remaining challenge now is to interrupt transmission.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2013 the Novartis Foundation launched a new leprosy strategy that focuses on interrupting transmission, to support the last mile in the ultimate goal of leprosy elimination. This strategy is based on consensus reached by a group of leading leprosy and disease elimination experts, who agree that a successful program requires early diagnosis and prompt treatment for all patients, tracing (also known as active screening) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for contact persons of patients newly diagnosed with leprosy, development of new diagnostic tools, as well as strict epidemiological surveillance and response systems to monitor progress. The aim of this strategy is to demonstrate that the annual number of newly diagnosed leprosy patients can be further reduced.
To implement this strategy, in June 2014, the Novartis Foundation collaborated with several International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP) members: Netherlands Leprosy Relief, FAIRMED, American Leprosy Missions and the German Leprosy and TB Relief Association , along with Swiss TPH and Erasmus University in the Netherlands and national leprosy control programs to introduce PEP in several pilot countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America with the purpose of reducing the risk to develop leprosy in contact persons of newly diagnosed patients.
The LPEP program has been introduced in Indonesia, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Cambodia. LPEP will run until 2018 for all countries, except Cambodia, which is set to finish in 2019. Once a new patient has been diagnosed, health services actively screen household members and neighbors of the patient and examine them. Symptomatic persons are promptly referred for multidrug therapy (MDT) and asymptomatic contact persons are offered a post-exposure prophylaxis (single dose rifampicin), to reduce their risk of developing leprosy by 50-60%. This active contact tracing of newly diagnosed patients is a targeted strategy to prevent leprosy and to accelerate diagnosis and prompt treatment among those most at risk. 
The LPEP program will build knowledge on the most effective and feasible approach to operationalize PEP and on its potential to impact disease transmission. It has also been included in the revised World Health Organization (WHO) Global Leprosy Elimination Strategy 2016–2020.
The LPEP research protocol has published in BMJ Open.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) Diabetes Atlas estimates that approximately 1 million youth under the age of 25 have diabetes in the world. However, the estimates for numbers of children and youth in many developing countries are very uncertain due to lack of data. Additionally, in children and adolescents, type 2 diabetes is on the rise in all countries irrespective of socio-economic status. IDF estimates that 80,000-100,000 children and youth around the world are in urgent need of assistance.
Lack of access to insulin remains the most common cause of death in children with diabetes and the estimated life expectancy of a child with diabetes could be less than a year in some areas. While many children die undiagnosed, other deaths are linked to lack of insulin or expert care. In some countries, expert care is available but limited resources lead to serious complications and early adulthood deaths.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The International Diabetes Federation ""Life for a Child"" Program was established in 2000 with support from the Australian Diabetes Council and HOPE worldwide. It is an innovative and sustainable support programme in which individuals, families and organisations contribute monetary or in-kind donations to help children with diabetes in developing countries.
The program appreciates that treating type 1 diabetes is generally complicated, but specific challenges in certain geographic areas make care even more difficult. Seeking to achieve the best possible outcomes for children, the program focuses on improving access to insulin, syringes, blood glucose monitoring equipment, and appropriate clinical care. The program also seeks to improve access to, HbA1c testing, diabetes education, and technical support for health professionals.
The formula is simple: contributions from donors go to established diabetes centres enabling them to provide the ongoing clinical care and diabetes education children need. The centers provide comprehensive clinical and financial feedback to the program management team in Sydney, Australia.
The program aims to provide:
Sufficient insulin and syringes
Blood glucose monitoring equipment
Appropriate clinical care
HbA1c testing
Diabetes education
Technical support for health professionals
Some centres need support for all these areas; others need support for only some components.
IDF Global partners are engaged in long-term multi-faceted partnerships with the Federation and support core activities and specifically tailored programs focusing on diabetes awareness, prevention, education and more.  For example, Lilly Diabetes has implemented the “Global Diabetes Conversations Program” to share experiences and best practices developed at regional congresses.  
The IDF Life for a Child program is currently helping over 18,000 chlidren and youth with diabetes in 46 countries. There are 20 countries with close to 100% coverage by Life for a Child.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
Diabetes is rapidly emerging as a major health-care problem in India, especially in urban areas. Furthermore, there is an equally large pool of people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), many of whom will go on to develop Type 2 diabetes in the future. (A person has impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) when their blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal, but below the level of a person with diabetes. Most people with IGT are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.)
India is in the midst of a diabetes epi­demic. Diabetes requires life-long treatment and impacts upon people's daily lives. It carries the risk of chronic complications.
These worrying figures of diabetes prevalence in India can only hint at the terrible burden of diabetes carried by adults affected by this condition in India. Millions of adults in India are leading their lives or are set to enter life afflicted by chronic and potentially life-threatening complications of diabetes.
Given the scenario of Diabetes in Urban India especially in Mumbai city and an impending health care disaster, this project aimed at the following target groups:
Working adults in Unorganized Sector Units in Mumbai slums:
 The Indian Economy is characterized by the existence of a vast majority of informal or unorganized labour employment. It accounts for over 68% of labour employment in Mumbai (National Sample Survey Organization, 2010). Workers engaged in this urban informal sector form the bulk of the urban poor and they work in small and privately owned enterprises such as; leather work, weaving, artisans, saw mills, preparation of food items for wholesale, recycling units, rag pickers, handicraft artisans, handloom weavers etc. The labor laws and policies have minimal control over these types of industries. Such enterprises operate vastly in the slum communities of the city and employ the people from the nearby communities and other parts of city of Mumbai. These enterprises are characterized by lack of space, poor working conditions with minimal or no facilities for the welfare of the workers and numerous work related health hazards. As a result of irregular and stretched work hours, stress at work, in-sufficient and irregular sleep/ rest hours, irregular food intake, absence of balanced diet due to lack of knowledge as well as lack of resources, lack of easy access to health care services, etc. pose threat of various lifestyle diseases including Diabetes among the lives of these workers. 
Public Health Workers:
 In order to ensure widespread awareness and education among the community members about Diabetes; it is crucial to integrate and coordinate medical, non-medical as well as policy efforts at the community level. Thus, the project engaged Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) under the aegis of Women & Child Development Department, Government of Maharashtra, which has a cadre of health care workers (recruited from the local communities) termed as “Anganwadi Workers” for providing health education and nutritional services to the community members with special focus on maternal and child care. The ICDS has a very wide network for providing these health care services in the city of Mumbai. Given below is the structure of ICDS scheme in Mumbai city.  These volunteers operate largely in the congested slum communities to reach the health care services to the masses including health education, immunization, etc. These workers normally are from the slum communities itself and have in depth knowledge of the community needs and challenges. However; Anganwadi wokers are paramedics and have limited knowledge and skills to diagnose, detect and inform the community members on the chronic diseases such as diabetes. Hence there is need to train them as Diabetes Educators who can reach out to the community members who have limited access to formal health care systems. The project also works on providing testing services to the CHVs and provide support for self management of diabetes. 
Teachers of Municipal/ Public/ NGO Run School:
Diabetes is common chronic disease of childhood, affecting infants, toddlers, children and teens. According to the conclusions amassed by the Indian Chapter of World Health Organisation, prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes is 12% in the age group above 10- 20 years India. Most of these children go on to develop Type 2 Diabetes; which is alarming. Yet, most people are unaware of the signs and symptoms of diabetes in children, and as a result, the diagnosis is often delayed or missed altogether. Children and adolescents spend significant amount of their time in schools and the teachers have great amount of influence on their lives. Thus, it is essential that these school teachers are educated with the basic information about the Diabetes, its causes, symptoms and the treatment available. With this knowledge, the teachers shall be able to identify the diabetic symptoms among the children at an early stage and counsel the parents for availing medical treatment. The project targets to train the teachers from public i.e. municipal schools, or the schools run by Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) which cater to the children from the underprivileged sections of society. Most of the children in these schools belong to economically poor, less educated families with lack of access to quality health services. Thus, the trained teachers serve as health educators for early detection and prevention of diabetes among the children thereby creating a more informed next generation. The project also provide testing services to the teachers and provide support for self management of diabetes.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
Project Component I: Activities for Testing, Early Diagnosis & Medical Referral Stakeholders:
This project component encompasses vital aspects such as sensitization activities, testing, diagnosis, medical referral etc. for Diabetes. UWM has carried out outreach activities with all three target groups of the communities i.e. Unorganised sector workers,  public health workers and municpal schoolteachers across the city of Mumbai.  Following project activities were carried out as part of outreach to these stakeholders. 
Method for two hours education session on critical aspects of Diabetes for the target community members:
Answering Pre- test and Post-test Forms: Pre-test and Post-test forms are answered by all community members. They answer these questions before and after the session. It is conducted to compare the knowledge of participants about diabetes before and after session. This process helps UWM to modify the flow and content of the awareness sessions and helps in evaluation of the effectiveness of the session. This also helps UWM in breaking myths related to Diabetes and in understanding effectiveness of the training conducted.
Documentary and Presentation: An easy to understand documentary in Hindi is shown to participants at the beginning to introduce the topic. After that UWM team discusses different aspects of Diabetes shown in documentary with the participants.
Blood Glucose Testing: After the session, random blood glucose level of participants is tested by Nucleus Lab - testing partner of UWM. Testing is done by use of Glucometer.
 
Based on this methadology following number of stakeholders were reached out for each of the traget groups:
Unorganised Sector workers
Total of 10502 workers have been educated with information on Diabetes and 10502 workers have been tested.
675 Workers were found at risk of Diabetes and hence, they were further advised for detail investigation.
Post detailed investigations; 182 workers were confirmed as Diabetic.

Public Health Workers
2055 public health workers have been educated with information on Diabetes through 44 trainings and 1993 have been tested.
A total of 89 publich health workers were found at risk of Diabetes during the testing camps. All these workers were referred to Municipal Health posts for further investigation and follow up.
Post detailed investigations, 3 were confirmed as Diabetic.
UWM is undertaking constant follow up with those confirmed as diabetic for undergoing treatment at the nearest municipal health posts or health facility.  Along with the referrals interventions for self and family management of Diabetes were also undertaken. 

Municipal School teachers
Total 2008 teachers have been trained as peer health educators and 1967 teachers tested for Diabetes.
114 Teachers were found at risk for Diabetes and hence, they were further advised for detailed investigation.
Post detailed investigations, 38 teachers were confirmed as Diabetic.
UWM is following up with those confirmed as diabetic for undergoing treatment at the nearest municipal health posts or health facility.  Along with the referrals, interventions for self and family management of Diabetes were also undertaken.

Project Component II: Monitoring and Follow up of the Diabetic Patients:
All community memers who report high levels of blood glucose during the testing camps are immediately counselled by UWM by insisting on the need for detailed investigation, importance of a healthy lifestyle and healthy food habits. These persons were also counselled so as to prepare them psychologically to accept the fact that, they are at risk for Diabetes. Also they are referred to the nearest municipal dispensary where the treatment is available at free of cost. Family visits are being conducted to further sensitize and educate the patients as well as their family members for better management of diabetes.

Regular maintenance of records:
A robust mechanism of patient diagnosis, treatment and follow up has been adopted by UWM in order to ensure efficient outreach. For this following tools and processes have been adopted and followed rigorously for all the project activities.
These are as follows:
Attendance Sheet: Each awareness session starts with filling of the attendance sheets by participants. This help in keeping record of the participants attending the session and in follow up for other activities.
Pre-Test and Post-Test Form: A simple objective test is conducted with all the participants at the beginning of training and at the end of the training. This is mainly to capture the level of awareness about Diabetes and the impact of the training in increasing this awareness levels. The responses of all who participated in the test are collated, responses analysed and the awareness level of participants before and after the training is computed in percentage. Thus guiding UWM in modifying content of the awareness sessions to suit the requirements of the target community groups.
Patient card for people who found at risk of Diabetes: This card is to capture primary information of persons who are found at risk during the testing camps. It is used by UWM representatives for future references and follow up.
Reference card: It is meant for the persons who are found to at risk of Diabetes during the testing camps. The details of testing, random blood glucose levels found in test and address of the nearest municipal dispensary (for patient) are mentioned for further investigation on card. This card remains with patient as a reference note which can be used by UWM in future as well.
Patient follow-up Register: For all those who are diagnosed with high levels of blood glucose during the testing camps, they are shortlisted for further follow up by UWM team for ensuring that they undergo detailed investigations to determine their blood glucose level and further help them with guidance for self-management and family management. Patient follow-up register helps keep a track of the schedule for follow up calls and home visits, etc.
Information Handout: UWM has also developed pamphlets that give information about symptoms, causes, prevention and control of Diabetes Type II in easy to understand pictorial format. These handouts are to help the participants in Self-Management of the disease and also educate their acquaintances and community members.
Feedback form: Project has developed feedback form to get feedback and suggestions on the overall awareness session and testing camp organized by the team. Usually school principal, head of ICDS project site and owner of unorganized unit fills it. The form is meant to receive feedback for improvements in the methodology and the content of the sessions so as to be able to maintain and improve the quality of the awareness session over a period of time.      

Family Management of Diabetes
This intervention has proven to be successful for management of Diabetic patients through family support and care.  As part of this intervention periodic home visits are undertaken to follow up on treatment compliance and sensitisation of family members for management of diabetic person in the family.  These visits consist of one to one discussions with family members and sensitisation on diet plan for diabetic person in the family, easy and cost effective methods of preparing nutritious meals, psychosocial support the etc.

It is pertinent to note that interventions for project target group of unorganised sector workers were undertaken at the workplace itself.  Being unorganised sector workplaces, these areas have limited space and challenges of noise, poor visibility due to inadequate lighting etc. Hence UWM could accommodate only 15-20 workers for the sessions at a time which meant increased efforts to be put in for each of the awareness session and testing activities. Moreover this being workplace interventions, UWM targeted early morning hours or late evenings to undertake these activities. This was done to ensure that the workers do not lose their hourly income during work time and could participate in the awareness session on wholeheartedly. Through such simple but effective strategies, UWM could overcome these challenges and have been able to manage the project outreach in the stipulated timeline. 

Diabetes Disease burden: 
Based on the analysis of the stakeholders, it was found that the high glucose level was 4% among the ICDS Aanganwadi workers, 6% among the municipal schools teachers and 7% among the unorganised sector workers.  This clearly validates the need for such interventions among these project stakeholders.
While implementing these interventions, UWM realised that there was no or very little awareness of this  disease among these stakeholders. Moreover there was clear dearth of public private interventions for advocacy on Diabetes among these project stakeholders. Hence it is imperative that such interventions are continued with long term engagement. This was a one of its kind of projects where UWM undertook interventions with unorganized sector workers, ICDS Aanganwadi workers and Municipal school teachers and could achieve significant impact.  
Especially with the unorganized sector workers, our experiences have been very revealing. Through the interventions we could break the myth (largely prevalent in India) that Diabetes affects only rich communities who have comfortable lifestyle.  Through this project with the unorganized sector workers, we could prove that people from underprivileged societies are just as at risk for diabetes. They work at enterprises which are characterized by lack of space, poor working conditions with minimal or no facilities for the welfare of the workers and numerous work related health hazards. As a result of irregular and stretched work hours, stress at work, in-sufficient and irregular sleep/ rest hours, irregular food intake, absence of balanced diet due to lack of knowledge as well as lack of resources, lack of easy access to health care services, etc. pose threat of various lifestyle diseases including Diabetes among the lives of these workers. These workers are generally ignorant about Diabetes or the ways to manage it or an understanding that they too are at risk for diabetes.
While implementing these interventions, UWM had a better understanding of the complete lack or very little awareness of this disease among these stakeholders. Moreover there is clear dearth of public private interventions for advocacy on Diabetes among these project stakeholders, and a necessity to scale up interventions with long term engagement.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In many parts of the world there exists a lack of timely diagnosis and access to quality care. This new five-year, $90 million investment in the Lilly Global Health Partnership will improve access to treatment for diabetes, cancer and tuberculosis (TB) and contribute to a company-wide effort to  reach 30 million people annually by 2030 (known as the Lilly 30x30). The expanded Lilly Global Health Partnership builds on and accelerates ongoing work of the Lilly MDR-TB and NCD Partnerships that have been running since 2003 and 2011 respectively. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Working with expert partners, the Lilly Global Health Partnership helps people living in communities with limited resources in Brazil, China, India, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and the U.S. Lilly is advancing its existing global health work in many of these communities while identifying new opportunities for partnership. Consistent with the company's evidence-based approach (known as Research-Report-Advocate), the Lilly Global Health Partnership researches new models of care, reports findings and advocates for the scale-up of the most effective solutions to help more people. 
The Lilly Global Health Partnership also includes a new $15 million commitment to the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI). This will extend an eight-year collaboration to accelerate early-stage drug discovery and preclinical development for potential new TB medicines.
The Lilly Global Health Partnership and Lilly 30x30 extend and accelerate work done through major global health programs supported by Lilly and the Lilly Foundation over the past two decades. These include the Lilly MDR-TB Partnership, which included a decade-long transfer of manufacturing technology for TB medicines, support of early-stage TB drug discovery and improved care in high-burden countries. In 2011, the Lilly NCD Partnership was launched to help governments and key stakeholders improve diabetes prevention and care for people in need. The Lilly Global Health Partnership encompasses and expands these continuing efforts under a single heading.  
In addition, Lilly works to improve global health through many other collaborative efforts, including ongoing product donations and funding for Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) in Kenya; support of the International Diabetes Federation's Life for a Child program; and hunger relief efforts. 
In order to reach 30 million people each year by 2030, Lilly will explore new approaches – in addition to the Lilly Global Health Partnership - within different areas of the business, including: 
Drug discovery for diseases disproportionately affecting people in resource-limited settings;
Product delivery and packaging more appropriate for people in resource-limited settings;
Innovative business models, alternative product pricing and patient financial assistance to improve access to care;
Initiatives to strengthen health systems and local treatment capacity in communities with significant gaps in care; and
New patient education programs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Tuberculosis (TB), often thought of as a disease of the past, continues to plague the world’s most vulnerable populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are around 9 million new cases of TB globally each year and about 1.5 million deaths. Drug-resistant cases of TB continue to grow, and it is estimated about 480,000 people currently have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). WHO reports that in the 27 highest burden countries, on average, drug-resistance accounts for 21% of retreated TB cases.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
With a majority of cases occurring in China, India, Russia, and South Africa, the Lilly MDR-TB Partnership brings together government leaders, global health organizations, country-level healthcare providers, community and advocacy organizations and other stakeholders in these countries. Lilly focuses on two immediate and critical needs: improved and expanded training and support of healthcare providers, and adequate supply and access to quality-assured MDR-TB medicines. Lilly's work involves piloting new models of care and healthcare provider training that, if proven to be effective, can be replicated in other communities. To address longer-term needs, Lilly also works with global and national partners to discover new medicines to treat MDR-TB.
The operational framework includes three components:
Research: Pilot new approaches to improve access to care and collect rigorous outcomes data
Report:  Transparently share data about what works - and what doesn’t - with governments, health experts, and others working in global health
Advocate:  Use evidence from our pilot projects to advocate for scale up of proven, cost-effective solutions for maximum benefit to people.
The Lilly MDR-TB Partnership is supported by the Lilly Foundation and United Way Worldwide.

            What are the health needs and challenges
Nearly a century ago, Lilly made a promise to make life better for people with diabetes. Remaining true to this promise, in 2011 they started the diabetes-focused Lilly NCD Partnership to help people at risk, healthcare workers, and governments better understand and manage diabetes.
While non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - like diabetes, heart disease and cancer - impact individuals and societies around the world, their impact is particularly devastating in low- and middle-income countries that are poorly equipped to act. Reported cases of diabetes have more than doubled in the past three decades: 347 million people worldwide have diabetes, up from 153 million in 1980, and this figure is projected to rise to 472 million by 2030 — 80% of these cases will be in low- and middle-income countries.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To improve health outcomes, Lilly works with partners using a novel operational framework: Research, Report and Advocate.
Research: pilot new approaches to improve access to care and collect rigorous outcomes data;
Report: transparently share data about what works and what doesn’t with governments, health experts, and others working in global health;
Advocate: use evidence from our pilot projects to advocate for scale up of proven, cost-effective solutions for maximum benefit to people.

Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are significant and increasing health challenges in Brazil. Lilly’s aim is to reduce the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in women previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes and to improve skills for healthcare workers caring for people at risk of Type 1 diabetes especially in rural and underserved areas.
The NCD partnership does this in two ways. First by evaluating the effectiveness of an intensive lifestyle change program to prevent or delay development of Type 2 diabetes in women who previously had gestational diabetes. Secondly, through developed Type 1 diabetes educational tools based on the experience and methodology used by Instituto da Criança com Diabetes (ICD).
India
The projected number of people in India with diabetes and hypertension is rising quickly while detection rates of diabetes and high blood pressure remain low. India is second only to China in the total number of cases.
The Lilly NCD partnership works to integrate diabetes prevention services, diabetes and hypertension community-based care, and improve diabetes self-management. Interventions include mapping local health conditions, community awareness, use of electronic tools, and training of health workers.
Mexico
With a high Type 2 diabetes prevalence and a majority of cases managed only by medical specialists, there is a strong need for greater diabetes prevention and treatment in primary care settings. To achieve this, the government is rolling out the Casalud model of care to enable Type 2 diabetes management at the primary care level. Lilly’s partnership is conducting rigorous evaluation of the Casalud model to enable continual improvement and strengthening. This will enable improved access to effective and appropriate care for diabetes throughout the primary care clinic network which covers 50 percent of Mexico’s population.
South Africa
South Africa has one of the highest rates of obesity in Africa while Type 2 diabetes is rising dramatically in both urban and rural settings. To improve quality of life of people at risk, the Lilly NCD partnership works to increase access to diabetes prevention services, to integrate diabetes and hypertension primary care services, and to improve diabetes self-management.
Through the NCD partnership, Lilly does this by training community-based health workers to diagnose and refer patients , launching peer support groups to raise awareness about diabetes, and strengthening clinic capabilities. Lilly is also leveraging current HIV/AIDS treatment capabilities and applying these learnings to a diabetes care model.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
“Making more health” is a global initiative to improve health in communities around the world, by identifying and supporting the most promising solutions to challenge health problems.
The partnership includes support for a series of programs aimed at identifying innovative health solutions:
1. Social Entrepreneurs Program  – this selects leading social entrepreneurs (elected as ""Ashoka Fellows"") whose ideas are driving cutting-edge systemic solutions in the field of health (more in specific, long-term care, medicine, mental health, nutrition, to acute care and sanitation) Fellows mostly work in low and middle income countries such as India, South Africa, Kenya, Brazil and Columbia, where different health challenges provide, at the same time, opportunities to find common solutions through collaborative efforts. In addition, two web-based changemakers competitions invite the general public to submit ideas on how to improve health in underserved communities. Within the various ideas, Making More Health’s Open Innovation Funnel aims to identify those that could potentially introduce efficient, low-cost solutions, facilitating the access to and increasing the standard of healthcare worldwide.
2. Youth Venture Program - this engages the next generation of changemakers - young people between the age of 12 to 24 - in designing and implementing healthcare solutions for their communities. So far, these projects have given young people the opportunity to develop critical skills such as team building, leadership, problem-solving. Eight of Boehringer Ingelheim’s country offices have hosted Youth Venture workshops and teams, while employees have actively supported the program by serving as mentors and coaches..
3. Executive in Residence (EiR) Program – this program gives Boehringer Ingelheim’s employees the opportunity to work directly with social entrepreneurs onsite. This allows an exchange of business and leadership skills, as well as a transfer of knowledge and know-how to social entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, it helps spreading an understanding and appreciation of social entrepreneurship and health innovation within employees and their own communities.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
So far, the program has:
elected 72 Social Entrepreneurs (MMH Fellows);
launched more than 300 Youth Venture Teams;
involved 32 countries;
started 15 Executive in Residence 6-month placements with Ashoka Fellows.
A number of fellows, are specifically working on mental healthcare. For more information on their projects, visit the MMH fellows mental health focus page.
In September 2014, a pilot project has been launched in the region of Coimbatore, in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu, in partnership with the Karl Küber Foundation. Read about this partnership here.
Based on its success, Making More Health will go on to support new additional fellowships, innovation and social entrepreneurs business innovation and exchanges, also through its employees’ engagement.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is the leading cause of death for children under the age of five in Tanzania’s Lindi region.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In January 2011, the Astellas European Foundation donated GBP 50,000 to support the provision of 15,000 insecticide-treated nets to pregnant women and children under five from 284 villages in Lindi Rural, Kilwa and Ruangwa districts. The project benefitted an estimated 19,883 children and mothers.
In addition, the project distributed malaria prevention awareness raising T-shirts and leaflets to women from 284 target villages so that they could pass on their knowledge to other mothers. Village meetings were also held and 5,000 house visits made to ensure parents knew how to use their mosquito nets and why they were so important. In total, 50,770 people benefitted from these awareness raising activities.
In 2012 and 2013 the Astellas European Foundation built on 2011’s support with additional funding of GBP 100,000 to maximise the impact of Save the Children’s work to prevent malaria for women and their families in the Lindi region of Tanzania. Over the two years 13,133 households, equating to 65,670 people, were reached with messages on malaria prevention.
Key achievements from the programme include training 78 volunteers on how to mobilise communities on malaria prevention knowledge and practice, equipping 20 core groups in Lindi on community mobilisation skills on malaria prevention and distributing insecticide treated nets to 3,922 children aged under five and 1,598 pregnant women.
Other outcomes from the programme include equipping community volunteers with bicycles, raincoats, rubber boots and stipends so that they can continue their work during the rainy season when malaria is most prevalent.

            Partnership objective
The Namibian Ministry of Health and Social Services has committed to eliminating malaria by 2020. The Zambezi region in the North of the country is a particular focus area, as it is a high risk transmission area, accounting for a third of the total number of malaria diagnoses in the country.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The Namibia Malaria Elimination Research Partnership (NAMEP) in Zambezi includes two phases: to understand malaria transmission and build capacity for surveillance and response; and to test innovative response strategies to eliminate malaria.
While Namibia has made significant progress in reducing malaria, reaching the stage of pre-elimination, it is now important to identify and treat malaria both in people with symptoms of malaria and in their asymptomatic contact persons. This strategy towards elimination is called targeted parasite elimination (TPE).
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Foundation’s partners include the Global Health Group at the University of California, San Francisco, the University of Namibia, the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme at the Namibian Ministry of Health and Social Services, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Clinton Health Access Initiative.
The Novartis Foundation aims to work with partners to define the optimal strategy to interrupt malaria transmission, while building evidence on how TPE works and strengthening health surveillance and response capabilities. The next phase of intervention aims to reduce the malaria burden and to determine the effectiveness, operational feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of TPE. Results will be shared with the health authorities to inform Namibia’s approach to eliminating malaria.

"232","Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP)","
        
        
            Partnership objective

The malaria vaccine implementation programme (MVIP) has been designed to address several outstanding questions related to the use of the RTS,S vaccine against P falciparum malaria parasite in children. Specifically, the MVIP is assessing the operational feasibility of administering the required 4 doses of the vaccine in children; the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths; and its safety in the context of routine use.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is transmitted by female members of the Anophelesmosquito family, which feed on human blood. The initial symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscular pains and mild diarrhoea. Infection can rapidly progress, leading to more severe symptoms, including delirium and convulsions, followed by coma and death.
Despite progress made using currently available disease control measures, malaria remains a leading cause of death in children in sub-Saharan Africa. According to WHO, there were 212 million new malaria cases and 429,000 malaria deaths in 2015, with Africa bearing the greatest burden. Research shows that malaria slows economic growth in Africa by up to 1.3% each year and costs Africa’s economy US$12 billion per year.  
Malaria can be prevented by controlling the breeding of malaria carrying mosquitoes and sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets. It can be treated effectively too, using effective drugs at the correct dose for the right length of time. However, vaccines offer an economical and effective means of preventing the disease and deaths each year. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) – also known as Mosquirix™ – is an injectable vaccine that provides partial protection against malaria in young children. GSK led the development of RTS,S over a 30-year period and conducted a 5-year Phase 3 trial between 2009 and 2014 through a partnership with MVI (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and a network of African research centres in 7 countries. Approved by both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the WHO, the vaccine acts against Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa. It is the first and, to date, the only vaccine to show a protective effect against malaria among young children in Phase 3 clinical trials.
Following an announcement by the WHO on 24 April 2017, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi will introduce the vaccine in selected areas as part of a large-scale pilot implementation programme, due to begin in 2018. It will be the first malaria vaccine provided to young children through routine immunization programmes, which will be delivered to half of the more than 750,000 participating children. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The first phase of the programme (2017–2020) provides initial insights on the feasibility of delivering the vaccine in real-life settings and on the safety profile of RTS,S in the context of routine use. The second phase of the MVIP (2021–2022) will continue to monitor feasibility and safety while also generating results on the vaccine’s impact on child survival. Taken together, these results will help inform future decisions on the wider-scale deployment of the vaccine.
GSK is also conducting a number of Phase 4 studies in regions where the RTS,S vaccine will be deployed. These studies will gather additional information on the vaccine’s effectiveness and on any side effects associated with its long-term use and will complement data from the pilot evaluations led by WHO.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people against malaria, a disease caused by infection with the Plasmodium parasite and transmitted by mosquitoes. Therapies are available for malaria patients, but the worsening problem of drug resistance in many parts of the world is making adequate treatment and control of malaria increasingly difficult. In addition, many insecticides are no longer useful against the mosquitoes that transmit the disease.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Crucell’s first collaboration aimed at malaria vaccine research was born in March 2003, with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK). In a collaborative preclinical study, a candidate Ad35.CS malaria vaccine as a stand-alone vaccine and in combination with GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate was tested. These studies showed that Crucell’s AdVac® vaccine efficiently primed and/or boosted malaria-specific immune responses.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2001, Astellas has been involved in a partnership with the Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM), a Malaysian state-owned enterprise, and TropBio, an Australian biotech company, for collaborative research based on micro-organisms.
This partnership is in accordance with the spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity and incorporates redistribution of benefits to the country of origin. Under this agreement, researchers from Astellas in Japan work together with Malaysian researchers to collect microorganism samples from the Malay Peninsula to be screened for potential use in drug development.
Astellas has conducted new drug discovery based on exact screening of micro-organisms for nearly 40 years and has accumulated fundamental technologies for biological research with microbial products, focussing on tropical rainforests where biological diversity is the greatest in the world.
The partnership contract contains a clause which stipulates that Astellas provide biological research technologies to Malaysia and share the rewards of any joint successes. Astellas accordingly provided 8 trainees from Malaysia with hands-on training in its own research laboratories.
The training program covers the isolation, culture, and screening of targeted micro-organisms. In addition, Astellas is supporting the construction and development of a research infrastructure in Malaysia for new drug discovery based on micro-organisms. This partnership helps Malaysia to introduce advanced technology from abroad, while Astellas is able to broaden its research efforts.
Capacity building in research is important for conducting drug discovery research in Malaysia. While Astellas obtains the seeds for drug discovery research from the natural Malaysian products, Malaysian researchers learn the advanced technologies for drug discovery research and obtain up-to-date equipment for research from Astellas.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
In total eight (8) Malaysian researchers stayed in Japan for six (6) months each, and many researchers received the on-site training in the laboratory in Malaysia.

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
People’s Hope Japan (PHJ) implements community health care and nutrition improvement projects together with the provincial health department, provincial hospitals, health centers, and village clinics.
After discussing with the Indonesian government the best provinces to work and listening to local communities to identify health needs, People’s Hope Japan (PHJ) set up their projects on maternal and child health. For nearly 10 years, PHJ provided educational programs and seminars in Indonesia on the importance of medical are in the community, but came to the conclusion that substantial improvement could not be accomplished without sufficient medical care centers that would offer 24-hour service and workplaces for midwives.
In 2009 Astellas committed to build birthing centers and health clinics in Banteng province to meet this health need.
Lessons learned Basic education of local residents is important to fully utilize the birth center and health clinic. Based on PHJ’s long lasting efforts of awareness raising around the issue, the importance of birthing centers and health clinics are well recognized and the utilization rate is high.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
By March 2012, Astellas donated 3 birthing centers and health clinics to People’s Hope Japan’s projects. At the start of the project, there was no place to consult with doctor in the area. Now, more than 70 patients visit the clinic per month, and more than 50% of pregnant women have a safe birth at the clinic where a mid-wife is permanently stationed.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The number of rubella cases has been on the rise in many countries. Rubella not only affects the health of infants—when contracted by pregnant women, it can cause risk of congenital disorders in newborns. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends each country to introduce rubella immunization.
Rubella incidence rates in Vietnam are high, so it is urgent there to strengthen measles-rubella combined vaccine production capacity to secure a stable supply of vaccines.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
The government of Vietnam has worked to improve immunization rates for vaccines to prevent polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and tuberculosis as part of its effort to lower the mortality rate for children up to 5 years of age under the National Expanded Programme on Immunization in Vietnam.
Previously, Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo Vaccine and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) offered technical assistance to Vietnam’s public corporation Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals (POLYVAC) to produce the measles vaccine for four years between March 2006 and March 2010. As a result of this cooperation, POLYVAC acquired technology for domestic production of measles vaccine.
The 2013 technical cooperation project utilizes the rubella vaccine production technology of Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo Vaccine, in addition to the existing measles vaccine production technology of POLYVAC, to build a current Good Manufacturing Practice compliant measles-rubella combined vaccine production system that is expected to contribute to lowering the rate of measles and rubella cases in Vietnam.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a debilitating disease that threatens the health and livelihood of more than 130 million people in parts of Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Onchocerciasis is transmitted through the bite of black flies and can cause intense itching, disfiguring dermatitis, eye lesions and, eventually, blindness. While the original goal of the program was to control the disease, recent evidence from WHO indicates that elimination is now feasible in Africa. As a result, the program’s strategy shifted from disease control to disease elimination.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a devastating parasitic infection spread by mosquitoes. It is caused by thread-like parasitic worms that damage the human lymphatic system. The disease is estimated to infect over 120 million people, with more than 40 million incapacitated or disfigured with swelling of the limbs and breasts (lymphoedema) and genitals (hydrocele), or swollen limbs with dramatically thickened, hard, rough and fissured skin (elephantiasis). Around 856 million people are at risk, and 30 percent of those infected live in Africa. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 1987, MSD* announced that it would donate MECTIZAN® (Ivermectin), our breakthrough medicine for the treatment of onchocerciasis, to all who needed it for as long as needed. 
To facilitate the donation and delivery of MECTIZAN, MSD established a multi-sectoral partnership, involving the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank and UNICEF, as well as ministries of health, nongovernmental development organizations and local communities. In 1988, MSD established the MECTIZAN Donation Program (MDP), housed at the Task Force for Global Health, to provide medical, technical and administrative oversight of the donation of MECTIZAN. In 1991, MSD, MDP and the WHO established the Non-Governmental Development Organization (NGDO) Coordination Group for Onchocerciasis Control.
In 1998, MSD expanded the donation to include mass treatment for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF), commonly referred to as elephantiasis, in African countries where the disease co-exists with river blindness. Over 400 million people are estimated to be at risk of infection in Africa.
For LF, the program collaborates with the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, a group of partners committed to developing political, financial and technical support for LF programs globally.
The program reaches more than 250 million people in 32 countries annually, with more than 2.8 billion treatments donated since 1987. 
The Mectizan Donation Program is the longest-running, disease-specific drug donation program and public/private partnership of its kind, and is widely regarded as one of the most successful public/private health collaborations in the world.
Lessons learned                         
While much has been achieved in the treatment and progress toward elimination of onchocerciasis, a number of additional challenges remain that MSD and partners are actively addressing.
Many of the community-directed programs have implemented at least one other health intervention in addition to MECTIZAN delivery, thereby helping countries and their partners to improve health care by expanding health services in these hard to reach communities. However, further integration with the LF program is needed.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Thanks to the program, over 2 billion treatments have been donated for river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, respectively reaching more than 146,000 communities in 29 countries in Africa, six countries in Latin America and in Yemen. The program reaches more than 250 million people annually. 
As a result of the investments and work of many partners, the efforts toward control and elimination of both Onchocerciasis and LF are advancing. In Latin America, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico have received verification from WHO that river blindness has been eliminated. In addition, the distribution of MECTIZAN has stopped in several sub-national areas in Africa where it is believed that onchocerciasis transmission has been interrupted. For lymphatic filariasis in African countries co-endemic with onchocerciasis, treatment has stopped in several sub-national areas and post treatment surveillance is ongoing in Zanzibar, Togo and Yemen.
The WHO established goals to eliminate lymphatic filariasis and river blindness by 2020 and 2025, respectively. In 2017, MSD announced an expansion of the MDP to an additional 100 million people per year through 2025, following the publication of new WHO guidelines showing that adding ivermectin to the treatment regimen used in LF endemic countries where there is no river blindness can accelerate the time needed to achieve elimination of LF.

            Partnership objective
The mission of Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) is to reduce the burden of malaria in disease-endemic countries by discovering, developing and facilitating delivery of new, effective and affordable antimalarial drugs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Millions of people around the world are afflicted with malaria every year with children and pregnant women particularly hard hit.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Medicines for Malaria Venture was established as a not-for-profit public-private partnership in Switzerland in 1999, following talks between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). MMV brings public, private and philanthropic partners together to fund and manage the discovery, development and delivery of new medicines for the treatment and prevention of malaria.
MMV is funded by foundations, governments and corporations. Regarded by WHO and the Roll Back Malaria partnership as an important partner, it now manages the largest portfolio of malaria medicine research in history, with nearly 40 projects underway at the end of 2008. MMV has mini-portfolio agreements with Genzyme, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi. Other partners include Chong Qing Holley, MSD, Shin Poong and Sigma-Tau.
MMV subsidizes 30 scientists at GSK's dedicated DDW research facility in Tres Cantos. As compounds move into clinical development, GSK provides clinical, regulatory and manufacturing expertise and resources via its global R&D and supply network. In 2008, GSK announced a new collaboration with MMV to identify novel drugs for the treatment of malaria. Research will focus on macrolide antibiotics, which may help treat drug-resistant malaria. GSK and MMV are currently developing tafenoquine, a potential new treatment for the radical cure of P vivax malaria).
The Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases is working with MMV to help to prevent, treat and block the spread of malaria by developing new classes of drugs that attack both liver and blood stages. In 2009, Novartis and MMV introduced Coartem®Dispersible, the first artemisinin-based combination (ACT) formulation developed for children with malaria. The medicine contains the same concentration of active ingredients as the regular tablet, but in a dispersible formulation that is easier to give to babies and children, which helps to ensure that this population receives the correct dose. The sweet-tasting formulation dissolves quickly in small amounts of water which enhances its use in young children. In June 2016, Novartis announced the expansion of its partnership with MMV to develop KAF156. Novartis will lead the development of this compound with scientific and financial support from MMV in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. KAF156, currently in Phase IIb clinical development, belongs to a novel class of antimalarial compounds that act against both the blood and liver stages of the parasite's lifecycle. In September 2016, Novartis published proof of concept study results in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that KAF156 demonstrated activity against both vivax and falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant parasites.
In 2008, MMV signed a MoU with Sanofi for discovery work, including early-stage molecule testing, and screening, plus clinical development of ferroquine, SAR97276 and trioxaquine. Starting in 2009, MMV contributed to the DNDi and Sanofi 'ASAQ field monitoring program' in Côte d'Ivoire. With approximately 15,000 patients, this is the largest study ever done on an antimalarial and should help African experts and government bodies to develop innovative pharmacovigilance methods in 'real life' conditions. In 2011 Sanofi and MMV announced a three-year agreement to research malaria treatments titled “Orthology Malaria”.  As part of the agreement, both parties will work together to identify, characterize and optimize new candidate compounds to treat malaria and conduct early development programs to demonstrate proof of concept in men.
In 2009, Pfizer and MMV signed an agreement which allowed Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia to screen approximately 200,000 compounds from the Pfizer compound library against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.  In 2010, Pfizer and MMV signed an agreement for a second stage of collaboration to optimize and develop promising compounds to clinical proof of concept based on target product profiles defined by the joint steering committee.
In March 2009, MSD and MMV announced a licensing agreement for an investigational drug candidate for the treatment of malaria in the developing world. MSD, whose researchers discovered the candidate, granted MMV an exclusive, royalty-free license to pursue the development of this investigational candidate for use in malaria-endemic countries. MSD retains the option to become MMV's development partner upon completion of the first Phase II clinical trial of the candidate. Also within the agreement, MSD has committed not to profit from its sale in malaria-endemic countries.
In April 2013, Merck's biopharmaceutical division, Merck Serono, signed a partnership with MMV. Together, MMV and Merck work to develop new long lasting anti-malarial compounds through current lead optimization programs, contributing to global efforts to find new therapies to fight re-emergence of drug resistance to currently available malarials. A first program has already been evaluated by the External Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) of MMV and has obtained full support for further development.
In June 2013, with support from the GHIT Fund, Takeda began to work with MMV, in a program to screen Takeda’s drug compound library for new candidate compounds that might have the potential to be developed into new drugs for the treatment of malaria.
Summary of impact
The collaboration has identified promising leads.
In its search for new molecules against malaria, MMV and partners have so far supported the screening of more than 5 million compounds for their potential activity against the malaria parasite. Three partners of the MMV-supported early discovery projects have gone a step further and released the data pertaining to the active molecules into the public domain. This bold move will enable scientists the world over to access these data ensuring their antimalarial potential be used to the full. 
In 2012, 331 million Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) courses were procured by the public and private sectors in endemic countries – up from 278 million in 2011, and just 11 million in 2005. ACTs are recommended as the first-line treatment for malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly Plasmodium species that infects humans. 
The Merck and MMV partnership is still in its early phase but has already proven very effective in identifying promising leads, and is the ground of the newly formed Malaria & Diagnostics team within Merck Serono. This team will have the task to create a mini-portfolio with the collaboration of MMV to address unmet needs in the currently developed MMV anti-malarial portfolio. 
In 2009, Novartis and MMV introduced Coartem®Dispersible, the first artemisinin-based combination (ACT) formulation developed for children with malaria. Since its launch, more than 300 million Coartem®Dispersible treatments have been delivered without profit to 40 countries, mainly in Africa. This makes it the first pediatric ACT to have been delivered in such large quantities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial form of meningitis, a serious infection of the meninges that affects the brain membrane. It can cause severe brain damage and is fatal in 50% of cases if untreated.
Several different bacteria can cause meningitis. Neisseria meningitidis is the one with the potential to cause large epidemics. Twelve serogroups of N. meningitidis have been identified, six of which (A, B, C, W135, X and Y) can cause epidemics.
Meningococcal serogroup C is the most prevalent in Brazil, accounting for approximately 67% of the cases in the country. In total, approximately 3,000 cases of meningococcal disease are reported annually in Brazil.
The Novartis meningococcal C conjugate vaccine Menjugate® is indicated for the active immunization of children, adolescents and adults for the prevention of invasive menigococcal disease caused by serogroup c.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In September 2009, Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics and Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED) signed a strategic alliance. The goal of this alliance is to supply Menjugate® meningococcal C conjugate vaccine for Brazil’s National Immunization Program (PNI).
This project began with Novartis supplying Menjugate to the state of Minas Gerais. In July 2010, it was included in the National Immunization Program. It has been structured to ensure in the short and long term the vaccination against Meningitis C of all Brazilian children up to two years of age.
Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics will produce the vaccine during the initial phases of the project while a complete technology transfer to FUNED is conducted. This will allow for production of the vaccine while technology transfer is ongoing.
This partnership enables supply of an agreed number of vaccine doses per year, which can help protect children from this devastating disease.
This partnership will ultimately make Brazil self-sufficient in meningococcal C conjugated vaccine.
The project duration is 5 years, with the option to extend it, if justified. At the end of the contract, NVD will have transferred to FUNED all production steps ensuring self-sufficiency.
To address the challanges of complexity of the technology and multicultural nature of the partnership, a global project management structure has been implemented for optimum interaction among the countries involved and to ensure fast decision and continuous learning processes derived from the technology transfer.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since the start of the program, the partnership has delivered over 20 million doses of the vaccine to the National Immunization Program.
On 2 March 2015, Novartis announced the completion of a series of transactions with GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), including the divestiture of the Novartis non-influenza Vaccines business to GSK.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
An estimated 1.3 billion people have no access to effective and affordable health care. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), developing countries bear 93% of the world’s disease burden, yet account for only 18% of world income and 11% of global health spending.  Providing access to health in these countries is a complex challenge. Improving access involves researching, developing and refining health solutions, creating efficient health systems and distribution channels, offering products at affordable prices and empowering health workers and patients. All health stakeholders, both public and private, must pool their efforts to overcome health access barriers. At Merck, we recognize that we cannot address all the access gaps and achieve the change we seek alone. We believe that partnerships, collaboration and dialogue are key to delivering sustainable access results.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Merck Access Dialogue Series is part of Merck’s commitment to expanding sustainable access to high quality health solutions to under-served populations in developing countries. Merck is leveraging its core competencies, expertise, knowledge and experience across the health value chain in order to address barriers in access to health in developing countries. It aims to achieve this goal through a strategic focus on our Four As of Access: Availability, Affordability, Awareness and Accessibility.
This multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral platform is aimed at raising awareness which is the empowerment of health workers, communities and patients, with appropriate tools , knowledge, information and skills towards quality and informed decision making around the spectrum of prevention, diagnostics, treatment, care and support.
The access dialogues are not a one-off event, but rather a platform for a continuous and creative dialogue and exchange on priority access topics and challenges amongst all stakeholders, including multilateral organizations, governments, nongovernmental organizations, civil society, foundations, research institutions and academia, health care professional associations, patient organizations, think tanks and private sector partners.
Lessons learned                             
In its efforts to address the affordability challenge, Merck hosted an access dialogue on innovative access and intellectual property (IP). This was the first ever dialogue of its kind gathering representatives from government, international organizations, research institutions and private sector and explored opportunities for Merck to join existing innovative platforms such as WIPO Re:Search, DNDi or MPP.
Merck hosted an access dialogue on accessibility/ supply chain challenges in developing countries, which gathered partners and stakeholders from the health sector and beyond to share cross-industry experiences in improving supply chains to deliver products and solutions to people in developing countries and explore how sectors can work together to achieve the common goal of strengthening the delivery of much-needed products to developing countries. Participants in this initiative include industry partners; international organizations; as well as experts in the field of global health, development and supply chain.
Merck is aware of the importance of partnerships and is therefore committed to fostering a continuous collaborative dialogue with stakeholders and partners, from the public and private sector, on important access-related topics going forward.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The access dialogue on innovative access and IP provided an open space for insightful and critical dialogue on how best Merck can utilize its capacities and competencies to address the affordability challenge.  The meeting helped realize common ground and opportunity for collaboration and collective action towards improving access to under-served populations through innovative thinking around innovative access and IP.  The meeting also demonstrated the crucial role of all stakeholders in ensuring a proactive and collaborative approach to IP.
Following the access dialogue on innovative access and IP, Merck joined WIPO Re:Search, an open innovation consortium, sponsored by WIPO, which shares intellectual property (IP) and know- how with the global health community with over 90 members. The platform contributes towards the accelerated research of new technologies and products to combat neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), malaria and tuberculosis (TB), with the aim of benefitting patients in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
During the access dialogue on accessibility challenges, it was agreed that supply chain management in developing countries could benefit from coordination between the diverse stakeholders involved in this field. At the moment, there are overlaps between the various country initiatives and country capacity could be better utilized. Participants concluded that there is value in all stakeholders working together to overcome delivery challenges and capture synergies.
From the meeting, the concept of an Accessibility Platform to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices as well as the undertaking of joint problem solving emerged. Through this initiative, the platform hopes to identify the most pressing supply-chain challenges to access to health and generate ideas on how wider sector can collectively contribute to developing solutions.
This collaboration could translate into a more effective use of existing supply chains, supported by evidence provided by diverse stakeholders, including the industry, international organizations, supply chain experts, NGOs, civil society, academics, and cross-sector representatives, among others. Through the exchange of ideas and collective action we hope to break away from siloed-approaches, thus contributing to the new Sustainable Development Goals.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Emerging countries are lacking access to quality vaccines.
Immunization helps to avert an estimated 2.5 million child deaths per year.  Nonetheless, millions of children in developing countries – almost 20% of all children born every year – do not get the complete immunizations scheduled for their first year of life. In 2013, the number of unprotected children under one year of age was 21.8 million. Nearly 70% of these children live in ten countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Vietnam and South Africa.
One key limitation is created by the time it takes to make vaccines available in low-income and emerging markets, a period that can go from 15 to 20 years.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Merck Millipore is a resource partner of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) and provides support to DCVMN's continuing education activities. DCVMN is a voluntary public health driven alliance of vaccine manufacturers (including over 38 manufacturers) working to strengthen vaccine manufacturers through the provision of information and professional training programs, technology improvements, innovative vaccine research and development, encouraging technology transfer initiatives, and educating the public about the availability of safe, effective and affordable vaccines for all people.
Merck contributes to DCVMN's training events through an Educational Grant as part of its responsibility as Training Partner. Merck has hosted technical workshops at several DCVMN regional meetings. The topics of these training events are selected by DCVMN and can be found on their website. A recent example of Merck’s education of professionals in this field was a satellite symposium to a DCVMN annual meeting in Hanoi, hosted in October 2013 on new technologies for vaccine development and supply. Merck’s experts provided an overview on cleaning and process validation with special emphasis on filter validation and integrity testing and implementation of single use technology (including risk assessment approach).
Merck Millipore also provides tools, technologies and services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The company is working in close partnerships to deliver innovative products and ensure their success.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Over 200 million people in Africa suffer from the widespread tropical worm disease schistosomiasis. Every year, more than 280,000 die as a result of this insidious illness, which is caused by flatworms and spread through stagnant water. People become infected by the worm larvae while doing activities such as swimming, fishing, playing, or washing their clothes. The larvae penetrate human skin, enter the blood vessels and attack internal organs such as the liver, colon, spleen, or bladder. The infection rate is especially high among children, and the symptoms that result are particularly serious; schistosomiasis stunts growth, causes learning disabilities, and leads to anemia.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2007, Merck has been supporting the World Health Organization (WHO) in the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa. Since the start of the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program, over 500 million tablets have been donated. To date, more than 100 million patients in total have been treated, consisting primarily of children. Merck intends to accelerate the process and is increasing the number of tablets donated annually to up to 250 million tablets in the medium term. In 2016 alone, Merck provided 200 million PZQ tablets to WHO for distribution across 33 African countries(Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Côte D’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania, Malawi, Mali, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia, Zambia, Zanzibar, Zimbabwe). In 2015, Merck supplied 23 African countries with tablets, a collaborative effort with the World Health Organization.  Merck doubled its donation from 100 million tablets in 2015 to 200 million tablets in 2016.
Praziquantel is the most effective therapy to date for schistosomiasis infections - often even after just one dose - and it is well tolerated. It is therefore on the WHO list of essential drugs.
The Merck Praziquantel Donation Program is conducted in partnership with WHO, each partner contributing its specific expertise. Merck’s role is to supply WHO with the tablets and to cover the logistic costs of transporting the tablets to Africa. WHO steers the distribution of praziquantel, monitoring drug distribution and disclosure.
Awareness and prevention are also crucial in the fight against schistosomiasis. Merck supports an educational program at African schools to educate children on the causes of the disease. To achieve this, Merck supplies schools and teachers with easy-to-understand materials for their lessons. Merck has also helped the Uraha Foundation set up a local radio station in northern Malawi. As well as reporting local news and culture, the radio features shows that educate people on schistosomiasis.
In partnership with WHO, Merck provides posters and booklets to African schools that are available in English, French, Arabic, Portuguese, and Swahili. In 2016, Merck expanded its education program and donated a total of 340,000 booklets to WHO for distribution in ten countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Burundi, Congo, Nigeria, Rwanda, Ghana, Sudan, Guinea Bissau, and Tanzania.
Lessons learned           
Since 2012, Merck has stepped up its commitment and activities with the aim of enhancing its contribution to the elimination of schistosomiasis by its 5 step approach:  
Extending the MPDP until elimination
Increasing annual donations of PZQ
Broadening our education program
Optimizing the current formulation of PZQ
Developing a pediatric version of PZQ
Merck recognizes that interventions beyond product donations are required to achieve elimination. In May 2014, Merck initiated the proposal to create a global schistosomiasis alliance. Merck is a founding member of this global alliance aiming at bringing NTD constituencies together to encourage holistic, integrated approaches to better meet the set elimination target of schistosomiasis.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In December 2015, Merck and Uganda Ministry of Health have joined forces to raise awareness about cancer and diabetes, as well as to help preventing risks of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The initiative is part of the Merck Capacity Advancement Program (CAP), which was launched in 2012.
The campaign’s objective is to deliver cancer education and diabetes screening to around 2,000 Ugandans, and provide them with advice on healthy lifestyles, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. An additional 30,000 Ugandans should be reached by diabetes screening and education during the “Merck Uganda Diabetes Day”.
The “Merck Uganda Diabetes Day” is part of the “Merck Africa Diabetes Day”, another pan-African initiative under the CAP program, which aims to reach 300,000 people in Africa in 2016. This initiative has also started in Kenya, in partnership with Kenya Diabetes Management Initiative, Ministry of Health and the County Government of Nairobi and will be extended to more African countries.
Merck is conducting numerous initiatives on cancer and diabetes education and screening. Previous to this, in fact, it has already partnered with the Ministry of Health, Makerere University and Uganda Diabetes Association to raise diabetes awareness through text messages via mobile phones (SMS) to healthcare providers and community members.
Estimated amount of people impacted:
2,000 Ugandans to reach for cancer education and diabetes screening;
30,000 Ugandans to reach for diabetes education and screening;
300,000 people reached by diabetes education and screening in Africa by 2016.
By 2018, the company aims to reach 100,000 community members through its combined diabetes and cancer awareness campaigns as part of its Merck Cancer Control Program (MCCP).

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Midwives are lacking in many countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, where there are only 42% of the world’s 300,000 skilled birth attendants to deliver 78% of global births. It is estimated that there is a need for twice the number as each year 300,000 women die during pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium together with three million newborns. Most of these deaths would be preventable if these often poor and isolated women had access to services close to their homes, provided by better-trained and better equipped midwives. Admittedly, since the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the global rate of maternal mortality has fallen by 44% in 25 years. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of deaths of children under five has fallen for the first time below six million (from 12.7 million per year in 1990 down to 5.9 million in 2015). But neonatal mortality has not decreased: the fourth and fifth goals of the MDGs are far from having been achieved, and progress is very uneven.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
To fight more effectively against maternal and neonatal mortality, the Sanofi Espoir Foundation has chosen to support 9 programs that aim to deliver better access to care for every mother and newborn child, through the Midwives For Life initiative. These programs are geared to increasing the number and skills of midwives by improving their training, promoting the vital role they play in everyday life, and helping them work in areas where needs are greatest, particularly rural areas. The programs boost networking between midwives and other health and community workers at town or regional level, and ensure that these partners all share resources and expertise to deliver the best possible aid for mothers and their babies.
Each program is based on a strong community spirit to boost education and prevention among families.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Africa has the greatest proportion of people living in extreme poverty — more than 32 percent or roughly 300 million people living on less than USD 1 a day. The continent’s environmental, epidemiological and geographical challenges — including low-productivity agriculture, a high disease burden, and high transport costs render African countries most vulnerable to persistent extreme poverty. The majority of malaria-related deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and a significant number of Africans suffer from water-related diseases and malnutrition. There is also a high rate of maternal mortality. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Since 2009, with support of almost $2 million from the MSD*'s Merck Foundation through 2013, the Earth Institute at Columbia University has been conducting a community health worker (CHW) training program to strengthen community health services for more than 400,000 people in 10 African countries, as part of the Millennium Villages Project (MVP). The initiative aims to advance the development of a professional cadre of CHWs to fill a critical gap in the delivery of primary healthcare for rural communities throughout Africa. The program helps ensure that participating community health workers are skilled, well-trained, properly remunerated, regularly supervised and fully integrated into their countries' healthcare systems.
A component of the program is the improvement of service delivery through informed decision-making processes and rigorous information feedback loops among communities, clinics, and management systems. The MVP-designed mobile health platform, CommCare, is being used to monitor performance of the CHWs.  Compiled in a monthly performance report, these “real-time” data allow managers and program advisors to identify areas for improvement, such as the tracking of vital statistics or quality improvement of case management, and to implement targeted CHW trainings. These data also facilitate the assessment of individual CHW performance, allowing managers to incentivize or promote the highest performing CHWs and to target performance improvement efforts for lower-performing CHWs.
To take full advantage of these efforts, the MVP team will incorporate the outcomes of the CHW program successes and its most recent scale-up efforts into policy recommendations and national implementation guides for each of the 10 countries where Millennium Villages are located. In addition, the MVP team will engage the national Ministries of Health to foster health policy dialogue as a bridge to long-term, sustainable in-country support for MVP activities.
Lessons learned
The Millennium Villages Project offers an innovative model for helping rural African communities lift themselves out of extreme poverty. The Millennium Villages are proving that by fighting poverty at the village level through community-led development, rural Africa can achieve the Millennium Development Goals — global targets for reducing extreme poverty and hunger by half and improving education, health, gender equality and environmental sustainability — by 2015, and escape the extreme poverty that traps hundreds of millions of people throughout the continent.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information:
MVP has trained approximately 900 community health workers, including 87 CHW supervisors, who are overseeing nearly 500,000 people across 14 Millennium Villages.  The expanded CHW supervisor training program provides tools for conducting observational and shadow visits to strengthen the performance of CHWs.
More recently, many of the program activities have focused on sustainability and government scalability.  For example, in early 2014, the Nigerian government launched a National CHW Scale Up initiative in Abuja, based on the MVP’s advisory work over the past two and a half years with the Government of Nigeria.  The MVP program also helped lay the foundation for a major campaign to expand CHWs and their efforts to help countries achieve the health-related MDGs. In 2013, the Earth Institute launched the One Million Community Health Worker Campaign to expand and accelerate CHW programs in sub-Saharan African countries.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Over two-thirds of all cancers in Algeria are diagnosed in late stage, and five-year survival is very low. In addition, the incidence of cancer, in particular breast cancer, has increased dramatically in the past two decades. Despite recent advances, a large number of women die from the disease primarily because of limited effective early detection, diagnosis and treatment strategies, particularly in rural areas.
Algeria is the largest country in Africa, and sparsely populated towns in the interior are far away from each other, making it difficult for the health authorities to build the necessary healthcare infrastructure to fight cancer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In February 2013 the first mobile breast cancer screening facility was launched through a joint partnership between the government, patient advocacy group El Amel (Hope) and Roche. This partnership was renewed in 2016 during Pink October.
This fully equipped truck, locally referred to as the ‘Mammobile’, brings trained nurses, radiologists, other healthcare workers as well as much needed facilities to remote regions within Algeria. The goal is to combine cancer awareness campaigns with screening facilities so that women with breast cancer can be detected early and sent for treatment in larger regions. Roche supports the training of local radiologists, nurses and other professionals, and equips the mammobile with the software for performing mammograms. Roche also support the logistics for the campaign in collaboration with “El Amel” and local authorities.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Through mobile mammography units in Algeria over 10,000 women have been screened since the initiative began in 2013.
As a result of this campaign, in 2015 the Government launched ""The National cancer Plan"", sponsored by the president of Algeria Mr Abdelaziz Bouteflika.  One of the main objectives of the plan is to increase cancer screening and improve early detection across the entire country.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Improving access to medical services is essential to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) such as reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. However, India is among the countries with the highest number of infant and maternal mortalities in the world, and Cameroon and Tanzania have some of the highest infant mortality rates and maternal mortality rates among developing countries in Africa. All three countries also confront the lack of easy access to healthcare services. In addition, medical facilities tend to be concentrated in urban regions, so access to medical care is a major problem in countries where roads and railways are not well developed.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Daiichi Sankyo and Ranbaxy have started a synergistic initiative to sponsor mobile healthcare field clinics in India, Cameroon and Tanzania as part of their global social contribution activities. The initiative has been implemented in India through the “Ranbaxy Community Health Care Society,” a non-profit organization established by Ranbaxy, and in Cameroon and Tanzania through an international NGO, Plan, utilizing Ranbaxy’s accumulated and rich know-how and experience in providing mobile healthcare services.
A mobile healthcare van has medical equipment and supplies for basic medical care, immunizations, maternal & child health services, health education, etc. Making the most of its mobility, it can provide greater access to medical and primary healthcare and save many lives in areas that are far from regular healthcare facilities.
Lessons learned                     
Through the activities, it is recognized that mobile healthcare projects must consider local needs, such as the variety of the transportation means.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In Cameron, the mobile health clinic has provided services to the regions of Bertoua, Bamenda, Biteng and Garoua. This includes child and maternal health services, providing children with vaccinations and training of community health workers to aid in the project.
In Tanzania, the project is conducted in Kisarawe, where the mobile health van visits 17 villages per month. In addition of mobile health services, the project organizes Health Days once every three months in the 76 targeted villages. Acitivities are mainly designed for mothers to learn about infant nutrition and to provide infants with check-ups and vaccinations.
In India, the mobile healthcare vans visit doctorless underserved villages to provide medical examinations and care for new born babies. The local health workers called ASHA also provide instructions on the importance of breastfeeding and nutrition.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the World Health Organization, malaria is the leading cause of mortality in children under five in Africa and constitutes 10 percent of the continent’s overall disease burden.  This partnership was designed to address critical gaps in malaria treatment and education in Ghana, Senegal and Kenya.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In each of the three program countries, Pfizer provided support to leading non-governmental organizations to implement and evaluate effective malaria interventions.
In Ghana, Pfizer helped  bring the public and private sectors together to find new solutions to the malaria challenge. The program specifically supported Family Health International and Ghana Social Marketing Foundation which demonstrated that investments in Ghana's licensed chemical sellers, small retail outlets which act as a major source of basic medicines, can dramatically improve malaria treatment, diagnosis and prevention. Through Pfizer's partners, thousands of Licensed Chemical Sellers (LCSs) received training and job support and developied closer ties to the communities they serve. In Kenya, Pfizer helped Population Services International to reduce malaria in pregnant women and children under five, two groups most at-risk for malaria-related mortality and morbidity. While Kenya is one of the most progressive African countries in terms of malaria programming, resources are still needed to reach women and healthcare providers, especially in hard-to-reach rural communities. Recognizing that more than 70% of women attend antenatal clinics at least once during their pregnancy, Pfizer's partners are providing a boost to healthcare providers and patients at these clinics by supplying improved training, health education and new information packets designed especially for new mothers.
In Senegal, Pfizer worked with IntraHealth International to strengthen the country's system of health huts, rudimentary clinics which are often the only healthcare facility accessible to rural communities. During the rainy season, when populations become even more isolated, these clinics frequently function without running water, electricity, adequate supplies or medicines. Recognizing the critically important role these health huts play in the country's healthcare system, Pfizer and its partners are investing in improving their infrastructure, malaria training, supply chain, provider skills, and community demand for services.
Lessons learned
Early partnerships position partners for success because of their collective skills and experience. Partner selection should expand beyond technical expertise to include long-term strengths that may be required later in the program. In advance of proposal preparation, collaborating parties should discuss and formally agree on the rules of engagement.
The Ghana program focused on building capacity of LCS in the management and treatment of malaria, and did not give consideration to other skills areas that would have made it possible for them to meet broader Pharmacy Council requirements. LCS capacity building initiatives should include other areas of their operation to ensure sustainability of the program.
Because LCSs were not regarded as part of the health delivery system, it was difficult to convince clinicians and other public health sector stakeholders that LCSs could be trained to distinguish complicated malaria and conduct referral of severe cases and pregnant women to the health centers. Changing the operational culture of LCSs that are hardly supervised and working with DHMTs that are not mandated to work with LCSs required engagement processes beyond the six months used in each district.
Engaging relevant stakeholders and leveraging support for program goals can accelerate its implementation significantly. In the case of MAM, goals were in alignment with those of National Malaria Control Programs and Ministries of Health. MAM teams led strong advocacy campaigns and brought key representatives from all relevant sectors together to ensure they are well informed about the program.
Additional monitoring may be required when working with CBOs. During the pilot phase of the program’s community activities, some CBOs did not deliver on the goals and objectives agreed. Thus, time spent upfront in setting clear deliverables helped to identify performance issues early and provided an opportunity to address them. 
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
By working with partners on the ground, Pfizer was able to treat, teach, build, and serve communities affected by malaria. Uniquely, Pfizer also supported a multidisciplinary team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to assist in developing strong and measurable pilot programs with potential for sustainable expansion through other funding organizations.
The results achieved were a testimonial to the partnership’s success:
Ghana: Over 1,200 LCS trained to correctly dose and administer ACTs, and to recognize and refer complicated malaria cases to the nearest health facility in Ashanti Region, Ghana. MAM trained LCSs were significantly more likely to stock an ACT (97%) than those who hadn’t received training (82%). In 2009 23% trained LCSs reported that they would recommend an ACT compared to only 10% of those without training. By 2010 this difference has increased with 84% of MAM trained LCSs reporting that they would recommend an ACT compared to only 60% of those without training. LCSs are now recognized as a critical part of the health care system and the government is evaluating additional roles for nutritional and immunization activities. 
Kenya: Over 1,600 staff working with pregnant women and young children trained to advise women on prevention and treatment of malaria in Nyanza and Western provinces, Kenya. There was significant increase in the prescription and dispensing of AL by public health providers after the intervention rising from 69.4% pre intervention to 87.6% post intervention. In both 2009 (pre-intervention) and 2010 (post-intervention) more than 90% of all caregivers with a febrile child had the knowledge that treatment for fever should be sought promptly and from a public health facility. However, prior to the intervention only 67.5% of febrile children whose caregivers had this knowledge accessed treatment within 48hrs while in 2010, after the intervention, this proportion had increased to 81.8%. 
Senegal: Community health workers trained in malaria diagnosis and treatment at 24 health huts in Tambacounda, Senegal. All health huts were also equipped with furniture, basic medical and surgical instruments, health management tools. There was significant increase in the proportion of febrile children that sought care from health huts from 13.1% in 2008 to 63.9% in 2011. Amongst those that seek care, there was an increase in the proportion that did so within 24/48 hours from 73.2% in 2008 to 82.3% in 2011. The proportion of children with fever that appropriately received an ACT within 48 hours was overall significantly greater in 2011 compared to 2008, increasing from 9.1% to 25.1%. Use of RDTs for children seeking treatment from a community source approximately doubled in the 12 months from 38.1% to 71.8%, suggesting that MAM activities were effective. By September 2011, 24 MAM health huts were in operation.
Pfizer worked with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to evaluate program impact and synthesize cross-cutting issues emerging from the programs, which are of strategic importance in the development of regional and global policy agendas on the delivery of health services. Communication between local M&E and implementation partners, as well as the overall evaluation partner was critical from the onset of the program and ensured that all partners are on the same page as to scope and timing of activities. The relationship was a complementary one rather than an investigative one.
The Pfizer Mobilize against Malaria Initiative included USD 15,000,000 of funding, evaluation assistance and the assignment of Pfizer Global Health Fellows to the projects on the ground to help in message and communications tool design, informal provider training, program evaluation, program administration, etc. 
The initial assessment and phased rollout supported better community participation and progress, and helped avoid repeated errors. Integration and recognition of community health volunteers had a significant impact of their motivation.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
AMR is a serious concern for the Americas, where there is a large use of antibiotics in agriculture, livestock and humans. With antibiotics readily available over the counter without prescriptions, drugs are being overused and misused, which is a major contributor of AMR. According to the World Health Organization, resistance to certain antibiotics for treatment of K. pneumoniae, urinary tract infections and Staphylococcus aureus are already occurring in some areas of the Americas. Further risks for AMR are linked to poor surveillance, weak health infrastructures and non-alignment of capacity to need in health care access and delivery.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To support the development of effective national AMR planning, the project aims specifically to:
Review current surveillance efforts underway in LAC
Create strategies to inform solution design for gaps identified
Create and test a pilot approach within five countries
Create a roadmap and associated time frame for country plan implementation.
Undertake a review of the pilot projects for efficacy, replicability and scale.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
While tremendous progress has been made over the last decade to eliminate paediatric AIDS, nearly 7,000 adolescent girls and young women are infected with HIV each week and more than 400 babies are still infected with HIV each day around the world, most of them living in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of them acquire HIV from their mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. Effective medical interventions are available, but most health centres are severely understaffed to raise sufficient awareness among mothers of treatments needed to protect their babies. The stigma of HIV that is prevalent in many African communities causes women to live in fear, making it difficult for them to get the care they need.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
mothers2mothers trains, employs, and empowers 1,500 local mothers living with HIV, called Mentor Mothers, as frontline healthcare workers within communities and in healthcare centres, in 8 sub-Saharan African countries. In one-on-one and group sessions, Mentor Mothers provide essential health education and support to women on how they can protect their babies from HIV infection, and keep themselves healthy. Their intimate understanding of the social and cultural challenges of living with HIV gives them a unique ability to form trusted relationships with other women.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
m2m's 2016 Annual Evaluation shows that the programme has virtually eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV for three years in a row, with an average transmission rate of 1.6%. In 2016 alone, m2m enrolled nearly 2 million new clients and helped to prevent HIV infection in over 700,000 children. m2m also has a positive impact on the Mentor Mothers themselves. The employment enables them to gain financial security. They also become role models in health centres and their communities, thereby reducing HIV-related stigma and discrimination.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
China has significantly strengthened its capacity for prevention and control of infectious diseases during the past decade. However, some epidemics such as viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS remain critical health challenges. Meanwhile, an aging population and changing lifestyles have led to a surging burden of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs), especially cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Chinese government has committed to achieving goals for the control of critical diseases such as hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and NCDs in its 12th Five-Year Plan. It is investing in expanding the coverage and provisions of a universal insurance system to reduce the financial burden of healthcare for all Chinese citizens; strengthening primary care services to improve availability and quality of diagnosis, treatment and care; and expanding public awareness and prevention measures.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2005, the Merck (MSD*) Foundation and the Government of China established the first large-scale comprehensive public/private partnership known as the China-MSD HIV/AIDS Partnership (C-MAP), to address HIV and AIDS prevention, patient care, treatment and support, in support of ""China's Action Plan for Reducing & Preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, 2006-2010."" The partners introduced the program in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, with the aim of developing a model that could be replicated in other provinces.
The Merck Foundation committed USD $30 million over eight years (2005-2012) to support this partnership.. The Government of China, through its Ministry of Health, is providing staff, facilities and equipment. C-MAP has project offices in three places: in Beijing; in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province; and in Sichuan Province’s Liangshan Prefecture.
C-MAP is focused on six goals:
Raising awareness and reducing discrimination among target populations through training and education;
Deploying comprehensive, integrated risk-reduction approaches to reduce HIV transmission among high-risk populations;
Establishing a service network to provide consecutive treatment, care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS;
Providing support to orphans and families affected by HIV to alleviate negative social and economic impacts;
Building capacity of health care workers and organizations and developing new anti-HIV strategies and techniques;
Strengthening HIV surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems and data management and analysis to track program implementation assess program outcomes, and identify and apply best practices in a timely manner.
C-MAP collaborates with approximately 11,500 people working in 1,600 implementing organizations, including departments within the government of China, medical and health institutions, civil societies, international organizations, grassroots healthcare workers, and beneficiary groups.
In October 2013, the Merck Foundation committed an addidtional $6 million over three years (2014-2016) to support a second phase of C-MAP to strengthen integrated HIV treatment capacity and cooperation between the township and county health systems of Liangshan Prefecture, and to expand the program to new sites in Chongqing municipality and Fujian Province to improve HIV/AIDS management and treatment services. During this next phase, C-MAP aims to further improve treatment coverage by strengthening the capacity of healthcare workers to support the implementation of effective patient referrals and promote quality HIV treatment through health worker training in HIV diagnosis, treatment and  disease management.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
C-MAP was the first large-scale public-private partnership between the Chinese government and a private multinational company focusing on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and control.
Since 2007, in addition to raising awareness, the partnership has successfully established an overall HIV prevention and treatment network in Liangshan.This, coupled with training, has helped improve the capacity of local healthcare providers, expand antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and created a replicable model for HIV prevention and control in other ethnic-minority areas. The collaboration brought new technologies to strengthen the testing capabilities of local labs, provided necessary lab equipment and medical supplies, and developed healthcare services specifically targeted to pregnant women to help prevent mother-to-child transmission.
In 2011, the China-MSD HIV/AIDS Partnership received China's most prestigious award in the charity field, the China Charity Award — Most Influential Charity Program, which distinguishes significant contributions to public welfare and charity work in China.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that disproportionately affect the poorest segment of the global population and thrive in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion people worldwide are infected or a risk of infection by one or more NTDs.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
As a global healthcare company, MSD* has a broad range of resources to address NTDs. For decades they have been directly engaged with NTDs through program implementation, R&D and policy and advocacy efforts.
In June 2009, MSD and the not-for-profit product development partnership Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) entered into a master agreement to support discovery and development of improved treatments for a wide range of NTDs.
The agreement covers a wide range of NTDs including visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas disease that infect millions of people. As with many other NTDs, adequate treatments suitable for poor populations are lacking. Current therapies may be toxic, prohibitively expensive, or difficult to administer, particularly in resource-poor settings.
Under the terms of the agreement, MSD contributes small molecule assets and related intellectual property via a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to DNDi to conduct early development programs for drug candidates for treatment of NTDs, with the primary goal of manufacture and distribution of drugs at low cost to the public sector in resource-poor countries. MSD and DNDi share joint intellectual property on drug candidates generated through early development, and MSD retains the option to undertake late clinical development and registration of these drug candidates.

Pneumococcal disease is a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and other life-threatening ailments. In 2005, WHO estimated that 1.6 million deaths were caused by this agent annually; this estimate included the deaths of 0.7–1 million children aged under 5 years. Most of these deaths occurred in poor countries and included a disproportionate number of children under the age of 2 years.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
MSD* and Serum Institute are collaborating to oversee the activities required to develop and seek approval for PCV and pursue World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification. Under the terms of the agreement, MSD, through an affiliate, will receive specific rights to market PCV in certain designated territories and Serum will receive specific rights in other territories. Both companies will contribute to the development and manufacture of PCV.

Antibiotic resistance occurs even with proper use of antibiotics, but widespread, inappropriate use accelerates resistance. In more developed countries, there are a number of contributing factors, such as over-the-counter sales of antibiotics, poor patient compliance, inappropriate selection of antibiotics and over prescribing. In less developed markets the situation is made worse by the prevalence of substandard medicines.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The most significant achievement of the project was that it made available to the scientific community a patient/physician friendly format of AMS which can be rolled out in day to day clinical practice at the patient bedside even with basic minimum resources at their disposal. So far MSD has rolled out this program in more than 500 hospitals across more than 26 countries including India, Russia, Colombia, Vietnam, Philippines and Brazil to develop AMS plans, resulting in the training of 10,000+ healthcare providers and implementation of 400+ locally tailored treatment pathways.  In future we plan to expand the program further in Latin America, China, Korea and Europe. Importantly MSD plans to measure clinical outcomes in those institutions where this program is rolled out and assess what clinical, cost and resistance benefits have been achieved. An AMS Mobile App was also launched in India to offer point of care AMS solutions in many Indian hospitals.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Every two minutes, a woman dies from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. If nothing is done an estimated three million women may die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth in the next decade. Most of these deaths are preventable.
While the burden falls most heavily on the developing world, certain communities in the United States and other developed nations are suffering significant and worsening rates of maternal death.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In September, 2011 MSD* announced the launch of MSD for Mothers (known as Merck** for Mothers in the U.S. and Canada), a 10-year, $500 million initiative focused on creating a world where no woman has to die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Drawing on the company's history of discovering innovative, life-saving medicines and vaccines, MSD for Mothers is applying MSD's scientific and business expertise – as well as its financial resources and experience in taking on tough global healthcare challenges – to reduce maternal mortality around the world.
MSD for Mothers is working with approximately 75 partners on more than 50 projects to improve the maternal health of women in 30 countries.  The focus is on the two leading causes of death - post-partum hemorrhage and preeclampsia - as well as family planning, which is known to play an important role in saving women’s lives.
Working in close collaboration with partners, the program operates like a “living laboratory,” designing and testing health solutions for women that can achieve broad scale.  Each day, they look for new ways to confront the complex challenge of maternal mortality by adapting the core strategies that have helped us succeed as a global healthcare company. 
In India, Senegal, Uganda, the US and Zambia 2656 health facilities have been strengthened to provide quality care, 10,875 health workers have been trained and nearly 6 million women now have access to affordable, quality care and modern contraception.
Companies rely on multidisciplinary teams to drive innovation, execution, and progress. The success of MSD for Mothers is enhanced by bringing together partners from all sectors that share the MSD mission of saving women’s lives.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
MSD collaborated with PATH, an NGO leader in global health technology, to identify game-changing technologies with potential to save the lives of women during pregnancy and childbirth in low-resource settings. Through this collaboration they developed a tool to help prioritize technologies that have the greatest potential to save women’s lives. This is looking at criteria including cost, efficacy, and ease of use in resource-limited settings – as well as commercial viability – to help inform decisions about where to invest scarce resources to reduce maternal mortality. To date, PATH has assessed more than 50 technologies designed to reduce maternal mortality and has made the findings publicly available.
In India, MSD is strengthening the capacity of private health providers to meet clinical standards for maternal care. In partnership with local organizations, including the country’s association of OB/GYNs, MSD is streamlining the process for nearly 150 providers to become accredited so they are eligible to participate in government financing schemes.
In Uganda, MSD for Mothers supports building a health ecosystem: strengthening franchise clinics, engaging local transport providers to improve linkages to care, working with drug shops to provide essential supplies, promoting savings schemes, and training community health workers to raise awareness about safe motherhood and the importance of giving birth in a facility.  In one year, the partners in Uganda added nearly 40 new clinics, trained 150 drug shop owners, established more than 25 “mothers clubs,” and recruited more than 120 community health workers. The program is expected to reach more than 150,000 women over the next three years.
The partnerships in Zambia are focused on researching and designing new models of maternity waiting homes, the residential facilities located at or near health facilities where women in the late stages of pregnancy can stay before giving birth. Between 2015-2018, the project aims to have 24 maternity waiting homes linked to high quality health facilities in 8 districts.MSD is also working in Uganda and Zambia as a partner in Saving Mothers, Giving Life, a public-private partnership designed to dramatically reduce maternal and newborn mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.   Since 2012, the partnership has reduced maternal mortality ratios by 53 % in target facilities in Zambia and 45% in target facilities in Uganda. The success of the partnership means it will now expand the program to Cross River State in Nigeria.
In partnership with the government of Senegal, MSD for Mothers is supporting the national expansion of an innovative model that offers private suppliers performance-based financial incentives to maintain a sufficient inventory of contraceptives and make sure these products are consistently available. All regions are covered across the country and 1,404 health facilities are already participating, with 3.2 million women who now have access to modern contraception.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The MSD* Medical Outreach Program (MMOP) is the primary mechanism through which MSD** donates its pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer health products to a limited number of qualified, US-based, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for use in their on-going, humanitarian programs in the developing world and in support of major disaster relief efforts within the United States and abroad.
The scope of MMOP varies from year to year and is influenced by changing medical needs in developing countries. Through the MMOP, donations are made in response to specific requests from our NGO partners. These partners have expertise in the delivery of humanitarian aid and a track record of handling medicines responsibly. The NGOs work with local partners, including governments, communities, and other NGOs, to assess needs and formulate appropriate responses to acute and longer-term health crises.
In conducting the MMOP, MSD adheres to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Guidelines for Drug Donations. MSD played an important role in the development of the guidelines through our involvement in the Partnership for Quality Medical Donations (PQMD), an alliance of NGOs and medical product manufacturers dedicated to raising standards of medical donations to meet the needs of underserved populations and disaster victims around the world.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2015, MMOP donated $31.1 worth of medicines and vaccines and $4.7 of disaster relief contributions. Donations of medicines and vaccines supported vaccination programs; provided disaster assistance, partner medical mission pack programs; and reached many thousands more worldwide through the ongoing medical programs of the NGOs with which MSD works. In 2015, the programme had reached over 78,000 people in 72 countries.
Examples include:
COMVAX®  vaccine donation valued at $1.3M for an immunization program in THE Dominican Republic. 
Donations of several MSD medicines to Merck Medical Outreach Program partners responding to the earthquake in Nepal.

MSD* is committed to seeking additional ways to reduce the cost of our antiretrovirals (ARVs) for people living in the world's poorest countries and those hardest hit by the epidemic, including through working with external manufacturers and suppliers to achieve incremental efficiencies.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
MSD has established a low-cost supply chain with generic partners for the commercialization of ISENTRESS® (raltegravir) in all low income countries and all of sub-Saharan Africa. The implementation of this supply chain has allowed us to reduce the price of ISENTRESS to USD $1.85 per day (ex-MSD) price in these countries. MSD has granted multiple non-exclusive licenses to Indian generic manufacturersfor the manufacture and commercialization of raltegravir in 60 Low Income and sub-Saharan African countries. In addition, in February 2014, MSD and Cipla announced a strategic partnership to co-market raltegravir, 400mg tablet for the Indian market.
MSD also granted royalty-free licenses for efavirenz to six South African generic manufacturers.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 8.3 million infants each year do not receive the most basic vaccines. One major reason for low vaccination rates in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization, is the lack of skilled health care professionals. As part of MSD's** commitment to the GAVI Alliance, it established the Merck* Vaccine Network - Africa (MVN-A) to develop sustainable immunization training centers in Africa. One of MSD's major programs in Africa, MVN-A reflected the company's commitment to improving access to medicines, vaccines and health care in the developing world.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
As a founding partner in the GAVI Alliance, a historic public-private partnership committed to saving children's lives and protecting people's health by increasing access to immunization in lowest income countries, MSD responded to this public health challenge by launching a multi-year philanthropic initiative to help strengthen the capacity of Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) health workers in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2003, with funding from the Merck Company Foundation and after a competitive grant application process, MVN-A grantees established training programs in both Kenya and Mali. Based on their success, renewed funding was provided to both programs in 2007, enabling both MVN-A grantees to extend training to additional health workers in Kenya and Mali and explore innovative training methods to address emerging immunization management needs. Following a second competitive grant application process in 2007, The Merck Company Foundation provided supplemental funding to enable two new MVN-A grantees to establish immunization training programs in Uganda and Zambia.
The four MVN-A training programs provided mid- to high-level immunization program managers with customized, hands-on training in vaccine management and immunization services. Each MVN-A program was managed and administered by two primary institutions that have forged a broader collaborative partnership of key national stakeholders including Ministries of Health and Education, non-governmental organizations, medical and nursing schools, and multilateral organizations such as WHO and UNICEF.
Lessons learned
The MVN-A programs have found that, while cascade training appears to be an efficient way to reach several management levels, it requires extensive ""training of trainers"" and targeted follow-up to effectively reach EPI health workers at peripheral levels. Supervisory training can enhance the dissemination of information to peripheral health centers. To maintain high immunization coverage, the MVN-A training programs identified a need to improve supportive supervision practices in each country. Further, they also noted the importance of making public resources available to conduct more frequent, focused training of mid-level EPI managers to support evolving national immunization priorities.     
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
From 2003-2010, MVN-A programs in Kenya, Mali, Uganda and Zambia trained more than 1,000 EPI health workers across all four countries. Trainees have returned to their home medical facilities to share their expertise and knowledge with fellow health care workers.
In all four countries, ""training of trainers"" sessions conducted by Ministry of Health and WHO EPI personnel enhanced the national training capacity of the MVN-A programs. A cadre of local MVN-A trainers is now available to sustain these efforts in each country, supported by the Ministry of Health and other national stakeholders.
As the partnership drew to an end,  MVN-A collaborators advanced efforts to sustain their training programs in close partnership with key national stakeholders. Ministries of Health remain highly committed partners in all four programs, having enlisted MVN-A graduates to conduct operational level training (Kenya, Mali, Uganda), disease outbreak responses (Kenya, Uganda), mass immunization campaigns in camps of internally-displaced persons (Kenya) and new vaccine introductions (Kenya, Mali and Zambia). Coverage surveys have also provided additional information regarding immunization practice and identify factors that helped to improve vaccine coverage.

            What are the needs and challenges?
Very few vendors develop instruments and assays that can monitor virus in children. Merck Millipore is developing the Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system to address the needs of adults and children. This system offers a 10µL blood sample requirement, the lowest in the industry. In addition, Merck offers a combined CD4 enumeration and CD4% measurement on all human samples.  CD4% measurement is required to monitor the advancement of the virus in pediatric patients.
The second challenge is in sensitivity.  As the virus progresses, the CD4 count and the CD4% measurements decrease.  Patients are monitored for potential recovery.  The ability to count CD4 positive samples at low levels can reveal if the treatments are successful.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Merck Millipore partnered with the University of California at San Francisco as a pre-clinical site to determine if the product had the potential to monitor the progression of the virus as well as the predecessor product, the Guava Auto CD4/CD4% system.  This was a very successful trial.
The true test for the Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system occurred at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon.  Both adult and pediatric patients were successfully processed on the Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system. A poster from that trial that was presented at the ICAAC meeting in Washington, DC in September 2014. The Muse Auto CD4/CD45 system worked well with adults and children samples. In addition, the Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system performed well with cytopenic specimen.
Merck Millipore will offer a more sensitive instrument that addresses the needs of adults and children at a modest price. The cost-per-test will be at very low price, opening access. Merck Millipore has added accessory battery UPS options that will power the instrument in the field for up to four hours.  This allows for ambulatory care as well as laboratory use. The product is very easy to use and intended for use in developing countries. The Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system is one of only a few vendors addressing the needs of paediatric viral patients.  
Lessons learned
The electricity and weather conditions in Cameroon can challenge laboratory instrumentation.  Most laboratories in developing countries are not air conditioned.  The temperatures can be quite warm and the humidity can be quite high under conditions close to the equator in Cameroon. To make the Muse Auto Cd4/CD4% more durable and operable under these conditions, several enhancements have been introduced.  These improvements include a new laser, a new mother board, new electric grounding capability, new battery powered uninterrupted power supply units, and new software developments adding an “extreme cleaning” function to maintain the Muse Auo CD4/CD4% system and improved auto-gating to increase further the sensitivity and specificity of results. Merck Millipore is now making these improvements. Once these enhancements are accomplished, the clinical trials in Cameroon will continue.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The Muse Auto CD4/CD4% system product release will be delayed until the end of Q1 2015.  Merck Millipore will then begin the process to gain pre-qualification from the World Health Organization.  In addition, Merck Millipore intends to work with UNITAIDS to fast track clinical trials to gain IVD acceptance throughout sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Despite major advances in the funding and availability of vaccines worldwide, it is estimated that up to a fifth of children worldwide still do not receive basic vaccines. The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa offers an opportunity to create innovative and cost-effective ways to address barriers to universal vaccination.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The initial focus of the partnership was a one-year pilot vaccination project in Mozambique, in collaboration with the Mozambique Ministry of Health. This project aims to establish if mobile technology solutions could increase the proportion of children covered by vaccination in Mozambique by an additional 5-10% through helping to encourage mothers to take up vaccination services, support health workers, improve record keeping, and enable better management of vaccine stock.
The partnership combines GSK healthcare and vaccine expertise with those of Vodafone, enabling mobile technology to help vaccinate children against common infectious diseases in Africa. Since the pilot programme for mVacciNation began in 2015, 52,871 children have been registered and 162,825 antigen vaccinations have been recorded on the system. The mVacciNation project is now being piloted in 50 facilities in Tanzania in partnership with Amref, with the objective of enrolling 74,713 infants by December 2016. The partnership also recently received approval to expand to Nigeria following a successful evaluation by the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency. This expansion will enable the project to reach thousands more children with life-saving vaccinations.
The project uses mobile technology to address barriers to increased take-up of vaccines in three key ways:
Mothers and caregivers are registered on the mVacciNation database and alerted by SMS to the availability and importance of lifesaving vaccinations against common childhood diseases. Mothers are able to schedule vaccination appointments by SMS and receive notifications of past and future vaccinations to ensure children complete the full schedule and become fully immunised.
Health workers are provided with smartphones with software allowing them to contact mothers, view and record vaccination histories, schedule vaccinations and report on follow-up visits.
Healthcare facilities are prompted to regularly report on crucial vaccination stock levels by SMS. This enables critical supply chain management and the availability of vaccines when and where they are needed, particularly in rural areas.
With funding from USAID and GAVI, the pilot in Mozambique is being independently evaluated by the J-PAL Africa research unit, based at the University of Cape Town, and the National Institute of Health of Mozambique.  The UCT team includes researchers from Yale University and Harvard School of Public Health. The evaluation will rigorously measure the impact of the program as well as assess its cost effectiveness, helping to inform scale-up decisions both across Mozambique and in other African countries.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Each year, nearly 300,000 children and adolescents are faced with cancer. The survival rate varies from 10% to 80% depending on the resources of the countries (UICC)
In industrialized countries, 80% of them can be cured. This figure falls to 20% or even 10% in a country with limited resources, and yet 80% of the children who are affected live in these geographies. The reasons are patent: lack of information, late diagnosis, and often difficult access to care and treatment. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To reduce these disparities, the Sanofi Espoir Foundation devised the My Child Matters initiative.
In operation since 2006 with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and other partner organizations, this ambitious program provides financial support, aid from international experts, and in-country networking for project developers. It is one of the most important initiatives ever implemented to fight against pediatric cancer in developing countries.
Main activities of the program :
Training health professionals in pediatric oncology to improve the care of the children; 
Decentralizing care so that children are cared for near their homes; 
Building networks of health professionals, both decentralized and cross-regional;
Creating cancer registers to monitor the local epidemiological situation and track patients;
Support for actions to manage pain, provide palliative care and psycho-social support for families and carers;
Advocacy actions, especially in partnership with the Union for the International Control of Cancer - UICC;
Information campaigns targeting families and the general public so they can recognize disease symptoms and improve early diagnoses.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 2006: 55 projects supported in 42 countries on 3 continents (Africa, Asia, and Latin America). 16,000 healthcare professionals have been trained, 25,000 families helped, and 50,000 children taken into care.

Nearly 1.3 million of Namibia's population of just over 2 million do not have access to proper toilet facilities, including 84% of all people living in rural areas. Diarrhea is the second highest cause of pediatric admissions in Namibia and is responsible for more than 30% of deaths in children under the age of five. In order to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Namibian government's aim for 2015 is to ensure that at least 62% of people will have access to adequate sanitation.Description of partnership activities and how they meet needs and challenges
In line with GlaxoSmithKline's Corporate Social Responsibility commitment to support the MDGs (especially those focused on child survival), a partnership agreement was signed in October 2008 during the first ever Global Handwashing Day, with UNICEF, Ministry of Health & Social Services of Namibia and GSK. GSK committed GBP 125,000 to this project of the period 2008-09.The project goal is to support the development of a National sanitation promotion campaign, and a National policy, strategy and action plan on Sanitation & Hygiene Promotion in Namibia. The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and improved sanitation. The campaign has two major components; firstly, to target the entire population, with a focus on mothers and other caregivers of children under the age of five, and secondly, to focus specifically on schools and school-age children, who themselves are often caregivers of their younger siblings

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Communities living along the periphery of river Narmada have limited access to roadways, electricity, health centres and primary education. In fact these villages, located in deep jungles, are accessible only by river. Due to remote access, the native residents of the area have been deprived of basic health care and other medical services leading to major ailments and loss of human life.
Furthermore, these villages face constant threat of water pollution due to urbanization, industrialization, agricultural run-off and improper agricultural and social religious practices. The waters of River Narmada represent the only source of drinking water for the communities settled along them. Due to consumption of this water, which is often contaminated, the population is at risk to water borne diseases of infectious or chemical nature which can also be fatal. Thus, it is necessary to increase awareness about the ‘usability’ of the water from the Narmada river on a regular basis.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The river ambulance aims to reach underserved communities living along the river Narmada and to deliver them primary healthcare. This project was launched by Narmada Samagra (an Indian NGO) in 2007 in Madhya Pradesh, India to reduce the pollution of the Narmada river banks and waters as well as to protect the health of tribes and communities settled around the banks.
The river ambulance can travel in 2-3 feet deep water the health services reach the door steps of people living in these remote areas. These ambulances are equipped with telephone connections that can be used as a helpline and can raft at a speed of 30 kms/hr in case of emergencies. Each ambulance contains: a bed for ferrying patients to nearest hospital in emergency, primary surgical tools, safety equipments (floating jackets, air tube etc), refrigerator for keeping injections and medicines, oxygen cylinder for emergency patients, medical kit with stethoscope, medicines and register for patient entry, test kits for heart related tests and different pathology tests like blood group, haemoglobin, sugar, pregnancy, malaria etc and solar cell panel for power requirement.
Merck is supporting and scaling-up Narmada Samagra river ambulance program through financial operational support, additional boat donation and provision of volunteer doctors to ensure that more patients will be reached. Merck has initiated daily testing of pollution levels of the River by deploying 55 dedicated personnel for the same along 100 banks. The Merck Millipore water testing kits are used for this purpose.
The initiative is part of Merck’s efforts around accessibility which focus on strengthening supply chain and develop localized health solutions to deliver and reach out efficiently at the point of care, thereby providing health workers, communities and patients with consistent access to health solutions, irrespective of their geographical location.
Merck’s support to the NGO Narmada Samagara contributes to the stability of the River Ambulance project whose functioning is dependent on donations and a regular supply of medicines and products. The River Ambulance helps expand access to health services and solutions to under-served tribal and local populations along the Narmada River, who are often exploited by local primary health centers and city doctors demanding steep fees. The program is scaling-up with the addition of one boat donated by Merck who will provide volunteer doctors and support operational expenses to help reach more patients along the river. Merck has also initiated daily testing of pollution levels of the River Narmada, a new activity as part of this project. This will allow for daily testing of river water by trained local community members using water testing kits as a way of informing local populations about the pollution levels of the river, aiding in preventative healthcare.
This initiative currently benefits over 40 villages on the banks of the Narmada River, providing locals with access to healthcare and solutions. The service runs five days a week attending to around 40-50 people each day, covering 200km along the banks of the river. Since 2014, the program has reached out to  more than 12,000 people.
In 2016, Merck donated a new boat to the initiative, a boat that can carry more materials and staff, and it can also transport more emergency cases.
In the month of April 2014, 55 personnel were trained for using the Water test kits by a certified technician in Bhopal and started water testing on the banks in May 2014.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
There are still a large number of women who do not screen regularly in the country and as a result of the high HIV rate many are highly at risk of cervical cancer. Many avoid prevention opportunities due to misunderstanding or cannot take them up if educated due to financial, transport or family barriers.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership formed between SBCCN, BMSF and Ministry of Health was aimed at increasing the number of clinics in the country able to provide screening and prevention for cervical cancer and basic breast screening at the same time. The partnership included Baylor Intgernation Pediatrics Aids Initiative (BIPAI) as one of 14 clinics however BIPAI has also become a key partner in training and capacity development of the target sites. The partnership has already allowed since 2015 thousands of additional women to access screening in locations where they previously could not or would have screen due to challenges with transport funds and long distance travel as well as hospital queues in the few previously open clinics.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The impact of the partnerships is in its early stages but can already be seen in the high numbers of women attending some of the new clinics for screening and treatment. Many women have reported to new sites for screening who have immediately been diagnosed and treated for pre-cancer or cancerous damage and may otherwise have not survived if the additional sites were not implemented. The rate of cervical damage being so high in Swaziland indicates the need for the new clinics and in time it is anticipated many thousands of lives will be saved by prevention through the treatment of pre cervical cancer and the detection of breast cancer at early treatable stages which is also being observed already in the dedicated breast referral clinics.
Measurement of progress towards objectives: 
Estimated overall value of partnership:
Approximately E1 Million in Equipment & Training
Estimated amount of people impacted:
About 16,000 additional women screened in 2015-2016

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is often a silent killer. It can cause both acute and chronic liver disease; ranging in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness, or even liver cancer. It often causes no symptoms until there is irreversible liver damage.
In many areas of the Middle East there are insufficient data about HCV prevalence and understanding around prevention and treatment. For example, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), estimates suggest that up to 2.5% of people suffer from hepatitis C infection.  However, less than half of eligible patients have access to treatment.
As in other countries, there is urgent need for education about the risk of HCV infection from contaminated instruments and certain traditional habits. Universal access to screening, diagnosis and antiviral therapy is also imperative.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In December 2012, Roche co-launched the first National Hepatitis C Awareness Campaign across the UAE with the Emirates Gastroenterology and Hepatology Society. The aim of the six-month campaign was to:
raise awareness of and education on Hepatitis C
accelerate prevention and control of viral hepatitis
strengthen relationships with key stakeholders
improve the diagnosis rate through screening activities
enable access to treatment for HCV patients
conduct screening activities across the UAE
The target audience for the comprehensive campaign was the general public, hepatitis C positive patients, charities, healthcare professionals and the media. To reach this nationwide audience, the campaign used a dedicated website and a toll-free number, sent 150,000 text messages, and distributed information cards in English and Arabic, as well as over 50,000 bi-lingual brochures. Numerous ads were also placed in newspapers and on radio.
Roche also helped the Emirates National Gastroenterology and Hepatology society conduct a press conference, send electronic newsletters to healthcare professionals and hold free screening clinics in malls and social clubs.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The campaign reached over 40% of the population—3.5 million out of 8.5 million people—and was well received by all stakeholders for achieving results that included:
over 1,700 calls placed to the toll-free number
49 screening events that tested 8,800 people, yielding more than 250 cases of HCV
36 mentions in print and online media and TV and radio reports
By working within the local community, Roche played an integral role in increasing awareness of the importance of screening, disease management, treatment options and the steps needed to increase a patient’s adherence to treatment.
A follow-on campaign launched in mid-2013, the “HCV Patients Accelerate Program” is a second stage to provide long-term patient access to treatment through charities. Charity organisations play a crucial role by covering treatment costs for those patients without health insurance or very low income.
The new program retained effective elements of the initial campaign, such as the toll-free call centre which enrols eligible patients into the program. In addition, it established a centralised patient database to track patients’ treatment progress. It also contacts various NGOs, who are key stakeholders, to ensure a smooth process and secure a full course of treatment for patients.
The program is endorsed by the Ministry of Health and is implemented in close collaboration with charity organisations.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Better treatment of disease demands constant research and development of new drugs. To maximize effectiveness, this research must be global, but many drug research institutes in the developing world lack capacity and expertise. This partnership contributes to the identification of starting points in drug discovery and development in diseases of high unmet medical need, with a particular focus on actinomycetes bacteria to help develop new antibiotics.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership between Novartis and BIOTEC was established to transfer technological know-how on the isolation of actinomycetes bacteria - the most important source of antibiotics. Novartis experts in drug discovery and infectious diseases educate BIOTEC staff on-site and give technical training in the use of modern instruments and in the cultivation, isolation and purification of natural products.
BIOTEC scientists are also trained in microbiology, chemical profiling and high throughput drug and animal pathogen screening at the Novartis laboratories in Switzerland. Elaboration of screening libraries based on microbial extracts and pure natural products are useful to identify novel mechanisms of action to develop new therapeutic approaches for a broad portfolio of indications.
Lessons learned                         
In a bioprospecting partnership the capacity building aspect is a continuing process, as new research results are constantly influencing the scope and direction of joint research activities. This demands high flexibility and trust from both parties.    
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The number of extract and pure natural products for general drug screening has significantly increased, giving very positive prospects for the partnership’s continued success.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The Philippines is committed to the achievement of development goals targeted towards reducing poverty, hunger and poor health conditions. In line with its commitment, the country is confronted by the challenge of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in various local communities. This is largely due to the prevalence of home births assisted by traditional birth attendants or TBAs, whose knowledge and skills are based on those passed on to them as part of family tradition rather than formal healthcare training.     
The NayBahay program was launched to contribute to reducing the local mortality rate in order to help save lives of women and children. In particular, it aims to address specific needs and challenges commonly encountered by provincial and local government units as well as municipal health teams in different locations, including limited community facilities that provide quality maternal healthcare services, lack of information on health needs and risks, and limited knowledge on local healthcare facilities and service offerings. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Under the program, the NayBahay Safe Birthing Facility was established to ensure that a facility managed and operated by qualified local health team members is accessible to women and their families. The local government of Minalabac in Camarines Sur was identified as the first community partner beneficiary for the program. Following construction of the NayBahay facility, the program has been integrated into Minalabac’s community health program with management and operations of the facility being led by the local government in partnership with its municipal health team. 
Zuellig Family Foundation (ZFF) is a program administration partner for the pilot. ZFF is a non-profit organization which provided support in areas including mobilizing the community partner beneficiary and managing construction of the NayBahay facility for the program.    
Lessons Learned   
Partnerships - program collaboration among institutional and community stakeholders supported achievement of sustainable improvements in local maternal and child health conditions. The partnership similarly guided the local community beneficiary and its health leaders in further planning improvements within the health system and leading initiatives to address healthcare needs and challenges faced by many women and their families.   
Programming - under the program, the municipal health team planned management and daily operations of the NayBahay facility. In addition to technical healthcare trainings, this helped increase knowledge and skills in maternal healthcare service provision for community members. Following the initial management and operations training, it is important for other learning activities to be planned by the municipal health office for its team of healthcare workers to ensure that knowledge and skills are further enhanced based on the patients’ current needs.        
Summary of impact and forward looking information
As of 2014, there have been over 1,000 successful deliveries recorded by the Municipal Health Office (MHO) of Minalabac at NayBahay. Since the facility started operating in 2012, there are no maternal deaths that have been reported. The total births at NayBahay represents 40% of the municipality’s total recorded births during the year with the facility accommodating the majority of women (76%) who delivered at birthing facilities.
With the increasing number of women in the community realizing the value of facility-based births, the MHO similarly noted that home births have declined from 40% in 2011 to 18% in 2014.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Wolbachia live inside the parasitic worms, known as filariae, that cause lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, two infectious diseases that together affect more than 150 million people worldwide.
While current anti-filarial treatments are effective against larvae and microfilariae, they require many years of consistent, annual mass drug administration in a given endemic community in order to also successfully eliminate the adult worms. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Anti-Wolbachia therapy is a new method of treatment that eradicates the adult worms that can cause filariasis by eliminating bacteria known as Wolbachia that live in the cells of their bodies. As filariae are dependent on these Wolbachia for growth, development, reproduction and survival, these worms can be effectively eradicated by first eliminating the Wolbachia inside them.
Anti-Wolbachia therapy is expected to lead to worm sterility and effective worm eradication, thereby reducing treatment timeframes and providing superior therapeutic outcomes compared to existing anti-filarial drugs. Further, as anti-Wolbachia programs are still in their infancy, this collaboration is expected to potentially provide a unique opportunity to make a significant contribution to communities affected by filariasis.
Eisai has entered into a collaboration with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and the University of Liverpool to jointly identify new drugs effective against lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis (river blindness), both major types of filariasis. Under the collaboration, Eisai works with LSTM and the University of Liverpool to identify and develop novel drug candidates that efficiently eliminate the bacteria Wolbachia. 
This approach has the potential to significantly reduce the timescale of elimination programs, to provide alternatives to existing treatments, and to deliver tools that can be used in areas where current approaches are failing or cannot be deployed. Doxycycline, an antibiotic, is believed to work in this way and proof of concept has already been established in human field trials, which showed excellent results although requiring four to six weeks of daily treatment and being unsuitable for administration to children and pregnant women.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
On February 2017 a candidate compound has been identified for this project. This compound is effective in eliminating Wolbachia in in vitro assays, it eliminates macrofilaria in in vivo animal models and has a desirable pharmacokinetic profile. The compound is being profiled for safety currently.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the IDF, there were over 7.8 million cases of diabetes in Egypt in 2015. Affordability remains the biggest challenge for Egyptian patients. The middle socio-economic class in rural areas represents around 68% of the population. This affects the level of health awareness and education of patients and healthcare professionals.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Sanofi considers that access to healthcare is not only a matter of the patient having access to affordable medicines, but of having the opportunity to benefit from disease prevention and to receive comprehensive care, from diagnosis to treatment. In order to achieve this and overcome the huge public health burden, Sanofi Egypt focused on 2 main arms to address these burdens. 
First Arm
Providing Healthcare professionals with continuous medical education developed through different partnerships in order to leverage their skills in diagnosing and treating their patients. The programs were targeting 5 main healthcare professionals (HCPs):
1. Primary Health Care units serving thousands of patients in rural areas through EG PULSE program in partnership with Health Authorities. Those HCPs are one of the main arms as they are in the direct interface with the patients and our objective is that they would provide them with the best quality of service while dealing with infectious diseases, ensuring prevention, leading to a better life style. 
2. Educate residence doctors through EG SCOPE program in collaboration with the American college of cardiology and Dale Carnegie providing accredited curriculum either from medical or soft skills aspects, to ensure all levels of doctors are having good standards of knowledge in hypertension and the capability to treat Egyptian patients.
3. According to a survey conducted during 2015, the pharmacists are taking a key role in advising patients and there is a need for reinforcing their skills. Therefore, the “Share the Care” forums were piloted during Q4/2015.
4. Unleashing the potential of dentists through the “DATE” (i.e. Dental Assistant and Training Educational program), reaching 500 dentists in 2016.
5. “EG Care” arm is designed for private doctors through interactive symposiums (case studies) Hypertension, Diabetes and family medicine 
Second Arm
Reaching the unreachable patients in rural most disadvantaged vulnerable areas, and providing them with treatment through access to medicine program. With this objective, Sanofi Egypt designed a specific affordable therapeutic portfolio covering the most widespread acute and chronic diseases, in order to suit this socio economic class and provide patients with quality medicines at an affordable daily cost.
In 2016, the initiative achieved the following results:
•  800 primary care physicians trained through EG Pulse in 16 Governorates
•  150 residents doctors were certified  by the American college of cardiology and Dale Carnegie
•  600 reference pharmacists were trained
•  500 dentists trained
•  1500 doctors trained through “EG Care”

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. The EVD case fatality rate of the current outbreak is around 70%; the average rate in past outbreaks has varied from 25% to 90%.
The current Ebola outbreak is the largest and most complex since the virus was first discovered in 1976. The World Health Organization has called it a global health emergency requiring an unprecedented, international response.
Partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
As the Ebola outbreak in West Africa continues to expand with isolated cases now being reported in Europe and North America, Novartis is working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in researching a way to inhibit Ebola replication.
Researchers from the Novartis Vaccines division have been collaborating with scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases since 2011 to evaluate two Novartis vaccine technology platforms for potential use as a preventive vaccine and post-exposure treatment of the fatal disease. Specifically, Novartis’ RNA-based vaccine and small molecule TLR7 agonist technologies have demonstrated proof of concept in animal models at preventing and treating lethal Ebola virus infections, respectively.
In addition to collaborating with US government agencies, representatives from the Novartis Ebola Task Force attended a World Health Organization consultation on potential Ebola therapies and vaccines in Geneva in early September and Novartis continues to follow guidance from the organization to help guide response efforts.
Novartis and its employees are also contributing financially and through product donations.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Approximately 31 million people die each year from chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer in low- and middle-income countries, which represents more than 80% of deaths from NCDs globally. By 2020, the WHO estimated that 60% of the global disease burden and 73% of all deaths will be due to NCDs, mostly due to the rapid increase of NCDs in the developing world.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Access program consists of a portfolio of 15 medicines to treat chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, respiratory illnesses, and breast cancer. Fourteen out of fifteen medicines are either on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines or pertain to a class included in the list and are among the most frequently prescribed medicines in these disease areas. These medicines are offered to governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other public-sector healthcare providers for USD 1 per treatment, per month. Novartis expects this new approach to be commercially sustainable over the long term, enabling continuous support in those regions. 
Novartis Access started in September 2015. In two years, the program launched in six countries: Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Pakistan, Uganda and Cameroon. In addition, advanced discussions are taking place to introduce the program in three Asian countries and seven African countries. Since launch, more than 800 000 monthly treatments have been delivered in four countries and 502 products have been submitted for registration in 24 countries.
Boston University has developed a methodology to evaluate Novartis Access that could lead to an industry benchmark and conducted a first baseline study in Kenya. We are also working with partners on the ground to strengthen the supply chain and improve drug distribution.  
Over the coming years, the plan is to extend the portfolio to 30 countries, based on stakeholder demand. The company is seeking partnerships with governments, NGOs and other public-sector organizations, with the general objective to strengthen health systems. Areas of potential collaboration also include programs to raise awareness about diseases, train healthcare workers to diagnose and treat chronic illnesses and strengthen medicine distribution systems.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
NCDs, mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, represent a leading threat to human health and development. According to the WHO's latest global status report on NCDs, NCDs are the world's biggest killers, causing an estimated 38 million deaths in 2012, with nearly three quarters of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries. 
In Kenya, 27% of deaths are due to NCDs. They account for around 50% of inpatient admissions and 40% of hospital deaths, dominating healthcare budgets. By 2030, NCDs are expected to contribute to approximately 60% of the total national mortality. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Over the next three years, the Kenya Red Cross will provide training to health workers and community volunteers, and screening will be increased at community and facility level for NCDs in Kenya. The Kenya Red Cross will purchase the Novartis Access portfolio to improve access to NCD prevention, treatment, care and support. This new partnership is part of the Novartis Access program, whereby Kenya was the first country to benefit from a portfolio of 15 affordable medicines in 2015. These medicines treat cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory illnesses and breast cancer.
The Novartis partnership with the Kenya Red Cross will focus on refugees living in the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps where there are many cases of diabetes, hypertension, cancer and asthma. In 2013, there were around 27,000 medical consultations for NCDs in Dadaab, representing  3% of consultations, with 43% being for cardiovascular disease. 
This collaboration will ensure affordable medicines to the Level Five hospital in the camp managed by the Kenya Red Cross. Currently, the Kenya Red Cross supports and follows up 151 patients living with NCDs. With the support of its partners, the Kenya Red Cross will implement an NCD prevention and management program in Nyeri and Nairobi counties. It will focus on awareness-raising of risk factors, screening for early detection and it will also offer treatment, care and support. 
In conjunction with the 2015 launch of the Novartis access portfolio and to support effective treatment of chronic diseases in Kenya, Novartis partnered with the Kenyan Ministry of Health, the Kenyan Red Cross, the Kenyan Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB), the Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK), Management Sciences for Health (MSH) and other key stakeholders. These collaborations support the healthcare system through measures such as reinforcing drug distribution channels and training healthcare workers to diagnose and treat chronic illnesses. Novartis is also collaborating with Boston University in the US to measure the impact on health in Kenya and steer ongoing development of Novartis Access.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Leprosy and the deformities it causes have often been viewed as a punishment from God. Many societies have dealt with leprosy by isolating the mostly poor patients in colonies for fear of the disease spreading. Although India has successfully reduced its share of the global disease burden, the country still accounts for the highest absolute number of cases.
Despite improved leprosy control, some patients, mainly those with delayed diagnosis, develop irreversible disabilities requiring specific care, correction and rehabilitation. Disabilities are secondary injuries which are not well understood, and can be avoided by early diagnosis and treatment. Patients with severe hand or foot disabilities, which prevent them from living normal lives, are still frequently stigmatized.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
For over 25 years, the Novartis Foundation has been active in the fight against leprosy. Spreading the message that ‘leprosy can be cured,’ the foundation has played a key role in reducing the stigma attached to the disease and helping patients reintegrate into society.
The Novartis Comprehensive Leprosy Care Association (NCLCA), supported by the Novartis Foundation, aims to prevent disabilities beyond the early detection of leprosy. The project team uses disability care — including surgery, grip aids and physiotherapy — to help those with deformities reintegrate into society.
NCLCA workshops include:
Early detection of leprosy, mainly among children,
Health education for patients with insensitive limbs to prevent ?injury, burns and ulcers (which ultimately cause disabilities),
Instructions on how to treat wounds and ulcers with a self-care kit,
Physiotherapy advice to prevent deformities from worsening,
Provision of physical aids such as hand and foot splints to help correct disabilities, and
Provision of instant grip aids to enable people with advanced deformities to perform daily tasks without assistance.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
By passing knowledge on to local health workers, NCLCA reaches between 800 and 1,000 patients every year. The adoption of the NCLCA’s modalities – such as grip aids, self-care kits and health education booklets – by the Indian government has increased impact even beyond these numbers. Over the past years, nearly 28,000 self-care kits were distributed to patients through the Indian National Leprosy Eradication Program. Other countries such as Myanmar, Tanzania and Sri Lanka have also adopted tools developed by the NCLCA.
Despite these successes, leprosy control is at a critical juncture today. The disease has limited spread and thus the level of international attention and political commitment is declining. In an effort to contribute to the last mile by disseminating knowledge about leprosy among health workers, the Novartis Foundation published the eighth edition of  Leprosy – for medical practitioners and paramedical workers.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In many developing countries, most people live in rural or semi-urban villages. Health education, health-seeking behavior and health expenditure are low in these communities, where women and children are especially affected by health problems. Health problems are also amplified by poor sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and a lack of clean water. In many communities, tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, mother and child malnutrition, gastrointestinal problems and an alarming rate of infant mortality are common. In India, for example, more than 65% of the population have limited or no access to healthcare, primarily due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2007, Novartis launched “Arogya Parivar” in India, the first of several Novartis Healthy Family program. Novartis Healthy Family is a social business model that builds local, sustainable capabilities for healthcare in developing countries.
Arogya Parivar (“Healthy Family” in Hindi) works with local resources and empowers villagers to help themselves. Novartis recruits and trains locals in remote villages to become “health educators,” who help inform communities about health, disease prevention and the benefits of seeking timely treatment. Local teams also work with doctors to organize health camps in remote villages – mobile clinics that provide access to screening, diagnosis and therapies. “Health supervisors” serve as the initiative’s local sales force, interacting with local pharmacies and doctors.
The program, which became self-sustaining in less than three years, offers more than 100 effective, low-cost medications for communicable and non-conmmunicable diseases that are prevalent in rural India. Its 500 traveling health educators and sales supervisors have become a welcome sight. 
Given Arogya Parivar’s success in India, Novartis has rolled out similar programs in Vietnam and Kenya. The initiative has been adapted to local market conditions and disease prevalence in each country. In Vietnam, the Healthy Family model is based on a public-private partnership. Healthcare professionals in public health roles collaborate with Novartis and travel to rural areas to conduct health awareness sessions as well as diagnose patients. Medical college students teach primary and secondary school children about the importance of proper hand washing, nutrition, exercise and keeping a healthy heart.
From 2010 to 2016, outreach in rural areas across the three countries has brought health education to more than 30 million people and direct health benefits to 3 million patients through diagnosis and treatment. In 2016 alone, together, the programs reached more than 7.7 million people through health education sessions.  Nearly 610,000 patients attended specific health camps triggering positive health-seeking behavior.
The product portfolio is adapted to focus on diseases most prevalent in rural areas of each country. To be included in the portfolio, products need to be simple to use, relevant to local patients and have instructions in local languages. The current portfolio of medicines includes TB and rabies treatments, antibiotics, topical anti-infectives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-fungal, anxiety treatments, diabetes medicines as well as gynecological treatments. Nutritional supplements, as well as products to treat cough, cold, allergies, diarrhea and calcium deficiencies are also part of the portfolio.
Through the initiative, local women gain access to products needed during pregnancy and birth, including calcium, nutritional supplements and Oxytocin, the WHO-recommended treatment for postpartum hemorrhage, which is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries.
Awareness
Health educators hold regular health education meetings that focus on prevention, hygiene, nutrition, and common prevalent diseases and their symptoms. Physicians are also educated through knowledge sharing and medical detailing of treatment options.
Accessibility
The program ensures consistent availability of medicines and healthcare in rural settings. In India, for instance, strong links with more than 60,000 doctors, pharmacists and distributors help to make medicines available in the most remote pharmacies. Through health camps, qualified doctors travel to rural areas to provide screening, diagnosis, treatment and preventive care.
Adaptability
Communications, product packaging and training are adaptable to local conditions. The product portfolio is also customized based on the local disease burden. Local health educators are recruited to adapt the program to local dialects and culture.
Affordability
Providing health services and medicines close to home minimizes travel costs, which can be more expensive than treatment. Many medicines in the portfolio meet affordability needs in these markets, supplying essential medicines that are affordable.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
One of the challenges of discovering drugs for diseases of the developing world is the lack of basic research into the underlying causes of these diseases – an example of this is dengue fever. Dengue fever is caused by any one of -the four serotypes of dengue viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. The challenge in dengue drug discovery is the limited knowledge about virus infection cycle and the lack of understanding of the relationship between viremia and severe disease progression. Novartis is one of the few large pharmaceutical companies working on research for dengue fever at NITD.
About 2.5 billion people, or 40 percent of the world’s population, lives in areas where there is a risk of dengue transmission and a certain small percentage of the infected patients develop into -life-threatening hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome that can lead to death. Over the past four decades, dengue disease has become recognized as the world's most important mosquito-borne viral disease.
Malaria kills an estimated 429,000 people each year, mostly among African children.  In South East Asia, the first signs of drug resistance against the malaria parasite have been reported and new drugs different from the current arsenal of antimalarials are needed to fight the resistant parasites.
Screening for drugs effective in infectious diseases is challenging because of the often limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and the death of validated drug targets. The best way to screen is thus to use the whole organism and look for compounds that cause cell death – Human African trypanosomiasis is one example. An estimated 70 million people, in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of contracting Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly. 7,197 new cases were reported in 2012, however it is acknowledged that cases are under-reported and that WHO estimates the number of actual cases to be 30,000. Current treatments have complicated administration regimes and have serious adverse side-effects.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases is a part of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research that, in partnership with other organizations, is dedicated to drug discovery research on neglected diseases for the developing world. As a small-molecule drug discovery research institute, it combines the drug-discovery expertise and cutting-edge technologies of Novartis to fight infectious tropical diseases, including Dengue fever, Human African Trypanosomiasis and Malaria. The NITD international team of scientists is engaged in neglected disease research efforts, from target discovery and screening development to compound optimization and preparation for clinical testing.
The NITD dengue team has worked with many of Singapore local and international collaborators to establish novel research tools and approaches, characterizing NS4B target to enable -drug discovery, establishing -Dengue animal models for antiviral testing, defining structure and function of Dengue viral proteins, and developing screening assays which have been used to identify several candidate compounds in the fight against dengue. In the area of malaria, Novartis is currently initiating clinical studies of two anti-malaria treatments developed at NITD, including a promising new candidate against drug-resistant malaria which is active on both vivax and falciparum malaria. This new class of antimalarial compound, termed spiroindolones, was discovered and developed from a chemical hit out of the Novartis Compound Library. An extensive medicinal chemical optimization campaign which focused on improving the activity and the physicochemical or drug-like properties of the molecule lead to the development of KAE609. KAE609 is the first new class of antimalarial with a different mode of action to the current drugs to enter clinical trials in over 20 years. In addition, a clinical Proof-of-Concept study in malaria with KAF156, an imidazolepiperazine, achieved a positive outcome (parasite clearance of plasmodium vivax and falciparum) and this compound is now moving forward in partnership with a new formulation of the antimalarial lumefantrine into Phase 2B studies. Novartis will lead the development of antimalarial compound KAF156 with scientific and financial support from Medicines for Malaria Venture in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Novartis has also identified PI4K as a new drug target with potential to prevent, block and treat malaria.
NITD is contributing to the effort to build the capabilities that are essential to enable the discovery and development of new medicines for the people in the environment where they will be used. NITD has provided training for drug discovery to PhD students and hosts Postdoctoral fellows since 2003, with the majority of the individuals coming from disease endemic countries.                    
Realizing the importance of fostering long-term training opportunities for drug discovery scientists in developing countries, NITD linked up with the Biozentrum of the University of Basel and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute to create a Master of Science program in infectious diseases, vaccinology and drug discovery. Launched in early 2005, this provides a high-quality MSc-level research-based training in novel approaches to tackle major communicable and emerging disease problems.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Phase II clinical studies with KAE609 demonstrated rapid parasite clearance for both types of malaria (vivax and falciparum); long-half-life of the drug supports a once-daily oral dosing regimen.
Clinical Proof-of-Concept study with KAF156 achieved a positive outcome (parasite clearance of plasmodium vivax and falciparum).
New malaria target identified with potential to treat multiple stages of the malaria life cycle, including liver-stage infections of plasmodium vivax.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is one of the world’s biggest killers and Africa's leading cause of mortality for children under five: every 2 minutes, a child dies of malaria in Africa. There were an estimated 212 million cases of malaria in 2015, causing an estimated 429,000 deaths.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Malaria Initiative focuses on improving access to treatment, helping communities in malaria-endemic countries deliver better healthcare and investing in research and development into the next generation of antimalarials. Focused on treatment, access, and capacity building, the Initiative is tailored to best meet patient needs. 
In 1999, Novartis  launched Coartem®, the first fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) antimalarial, prequalified by the WHO for its efficacy, safety and quality (and on the WHO’s Model List of Essential Medicines). Coartem® has a cure rate of over 95% of patients after a 3-day treatment course and a demonstrated safety profile. Coartem® combines artemether, a derivative of artemisinin (from the Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua), with a synthetic substance, lumefantrine. Lumefantrine has never been used as a monotherapy reducing the risk of resistance against the treatment compared to other ACTs.  In 2009, Novartis and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) introduced Coartem® Dispersible, the first ACT formulation specifically developed to address the treatment needs of millions of children with malaria. Although children are the most vulnerable to malaria, there was until then no treatment adapted for this patient group. Prior to this innovative pediatric medicine, health workers and parents had to crush bitter-tasting antimalarial tablets for children to swallow.
Sweet-tasting Coartem®Dispersible tablets dissolve quickly in small amounts of water, easing administration and ensuring effective dosing for children. Coartem®Dispersible contains the same amounts of artemether and lumefantrine as Coartem® tablets (20mg/120mg) and delivers the same high cure rates.
However, rising resistance to artemisinin and decreasing drug efficiency threatens the global control of malaria, meaning new drugs are needed. In September 2016, Novartis published proof of concept study results showing that its new antimalarial compound, KAF156, demonstrated activity against both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, two main parasites responsible for the majority of malaria deaths. This drug is even shown to work against artemisinin-resistant parasites. In line with WHO guidance that antimalarials be co-formulated to mitigate the risk of parasite resistance development, it is expected that KAF156 will become part of a combination regimen when used to treat malaria. 
Education being a key factor in malaria control, the Novartis Malaria Initiative developed a program to train healthcare workers and the communities they serve. This includes materials and courses for healthcare workers and mothers/caregivers – translated into several languages and distributed free of charge. 
Further, Novartis also brings together the managers of national malaria control programs across Africa to share best practice in community awareness, healthcare worker training, stock management and distribution, and health impact measurement. In 2016, the fifteenth NMCP workshop was held in Senegal.
In an effort to tackle stock-outs of antimalarials in malaria-endemic countries, Novartis joined forces with private and public partners to launch SMS for Life in 2009. The program uses mobile and digital technology to track stocks of key antimalarials and other essential medicines in rural health facilities. The program was initially launched in Tanzania, but has since been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in Kenya, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. Over the years, the scope of the program has also expanded to more disease areas and health parameters.
Building on the success of SMS for Life, a new enhanced version, SMS for Life 2.0 was launched in 2016. In addition to stock visibility, the tablet-based platform enables to collect timely disease surveillance data and offers training programs and educational video resources to support the continuous education of health workers.
Since the start, the Novartis Malaria Initiative has worked with its Chinese suppliers of artemether and lumefantrine to help them to improve manufacturing processes and productivity, raise product quality and achieve international GMP standards. Assistance provided has included training in quality assurance, quality control, laboratory analysis, regulatory requirements and cost management. More recently, the Novartis Malaria Initiative has also worked with partners to expand cultivation of Artemisia annua in Madagascar. 
Lessons learned    
Malaria elimination requires action on several interconnected fronts – quality, affordability and accessibility of treatments are crucial, as well as effective case management, ensuring patient adherence and staying one step ahead of the parasite – but most importantly, it requires joint action and partnerships.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 2001, Novartis has provided more than 850 million treatment courses of Coartem® and Coartem®Dispersible. Further, since its launch in 2009, more than 300 million treatments of Coartem®Dispersible alone have been delivered without profit to 40 countries, mainly in Africa, making it the first pediatric ACT to have been delivered in such large quantities.
Altogether, from 2001 to 2015, the WHO estimates that 6.2 million lives have been saved and the upward disease spiral reversed thanks to a concerted international effort to scale up interventions.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is one of the most widespread infectious diseases, and claims the lives of an estimated 429,000 people a year, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa. A child dies of malaria every 2 minutes in Africa. Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of contracting malaria. Children and pregnant women are among the most vulnerable. Drug resistance to most common antimalarials is increasing.
Two major malaria-causing organisms are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD) is collaborating with several partners, including the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, and  the Biomedical Primates Research Center (Netherlands) to discover new antimalarial compounds that target both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The discovery program is supported in part by the Wellcome Trust, the Singapore Economic Development Board and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV).
The NITD and its partners are developing a potential one-dose cure for Plasmodium falciparum, and a curative modality for Plasmodium vivax. Two compounds resulting from these drug discovery efforts are currently in Phase II clinical trials: KAE609 and KAF156. These two compounds are from distinct chemical classes and target different malaria parasite pathways. If successfully developed, they would be the first new antimalarials in many years not belonging to the artemisinin class, and provide completely new options to treat the disease
Summary of impact and forward looking information
KAE609 belongs to a new class called spiroindolones, the first true innovation since the launch of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). It kills the blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax through a novel mechanism of action, including parasites that have developed drug resistance. It also appears to be effective against the sexual forms of the parasite, so could also help prevent disease transmission. In 2012, KAE609 successfully achieved Proof of Concept (PoC) in a trial conducted in Asia, including a site in Thailand near the Myanmar border where resistance to current therapies has been reported.
We are developing KAF156 with scientific and financial support from Medicines for Malaria Venture (in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), exploring ways to combine it with another agent to achieve a new treatment option for malaria. KAF156, currently in Phase IIb clinical development, belongs to a novel class of antimalarial compounds called imidazolopiperazines, that act against both the blood and liver stages of the parasite's lifecycle. In September 2016, Novartis published proof of concept study results in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that KAF156 demonstrated activity against both vivax and falciparum malaria, including artemisinin-resistant parasites.
In addition, our scientists are working on other projects, targeting yet another novel mechanism against malaria.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Infectious diseases impose the major health burden in the developing world. There is a desperate need for effective, affordable and accessible vaccines to combat these neglected infectious diseases that affect over two billion people in the developing world. Novartis is committed to improving global health and the Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH) is an important part of that strategy as they discover and develop vaccines specifically addressing the needs of developing countries.
Invasive salmonella, Shigella and Meningitis are major neglected diseases of developing countries. Together these diseases are responsible for well in excess of 160 million clinical cases per year with more than 1 million deaths. These diseases predominantly infect the poorest proportion of the population and particularly impact on young children.
A major bottleneck in the path to new vaccines is the expertise and facilities needed to turn a laboratory concept into high quality vaccines that are both clinically effective and economically viable for manufacture.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health (NVGH) is a part of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research that, in partnership with other organizations, aims to develop effective and affordable vaccines for neglected infectious diseases of impoverished communities. In striving to achieve this mission, NVGH aims to substantially reduce development risks and cost of new vaccines so that manufacturers will be able to viably produce and distribute these vaccines to the public health sector of the developing world. NVGH's role is to undertake the translational research required to take a laboratory concept through development to the human Proof of Concept and then to transfer this knowledge to a manufacturer.
Lessons learned                          
New paradigms are needed for developing sustainable production of vaccines for neglected diseases and this will be the subject of ongoing investigations. In 2011 there was a major effort in addressing antigenic diversity of target antigens, particularly though a new partially EU funded initiative, GENDRIVAX. This initiative involves multiple partners – demonstrating the power of combining academics and industry in the design of vaccine issues. For more on this initiative click here.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
While there has been no new tuberculosis treatments developed in nearly 50 years, more than 12 million people around the world currently suffer from tuberculosis. Drug resistance TB has been emerged and spread due to the inadequacy of treatment. Lack of TB drug resistance surveillance tools and TB management strategy are key needs in the African region.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Validation of the molecular tool was accomplished by the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases located in Singapore, one of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, before the technology was transferred to IHI. A TB genotyping reference center was set up at IHI-Bagamoyo, Tanzania, where local infrastructure for biomedical research already existed. The reference center will ultimately serve the entire Southern Africa region.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
This partnership has resulted in successful transfer of technology, knowhow and expertise to IHI Bagamoyo and this center now has independent capacity for testing clinical samples e.g. sputum, blood for diagnostic purposes.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Leishmaniasis occurs in 98 countries with 350 million people living at risk worldwide. Existing treatments are difficult to administer, toxic, and costly. Drug resistance is also an increasing problem. Chagas disease is endemic in 21 countries across Latin America and kills more people in the region than any other parasite-borne disease, including malaria.  [1]
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The project brings together Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and five pharmaceutical companies: Eisai, Shionogi, Takeda, AstraZeneca and most recently Celgene. By using a multilateral, simultaneous search process across the five global pharmaceutical companies, DNDi will access thousands of unique compounds, generated over many decades of research, to screen for potential treatments or cures for these diseases.
The new process starts with DNDi providing all five companies with a common chemical starting point, the ‘seed’ compound. This compound will have shown promising results against Leishmania donovani or Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasites that cause leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, but may not yet be optimal for use as a future treatment. DNDi will then select the best ‘hits’ for further testing. This process will be repeated up to three times, with each new iteration starting from an improved seed compound identified from within one of the four partner’s collections and shared with all.
Any progress or successful new treatment for leishmaniasis or Chagas disease resulting from the Drug Discovery Booster will be attributed to the collective effort of all partners, which have also agreed that no intellectual property barriers will be imposed to a new treatment if successful.
This partnership leverages support of the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund), a public-private partnership between six Japanese pharmaceutical companies, the Japanese Government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Current status (as of July 2016):
1st Seed: Hit series identified2nd Seed: Improved hits identified by the first and second round of Booster screening have been resubmitted to the Booster process (third iteration). New compounds identified from this second iteration are currently under screening at Institut Pasteur Korea.3rd Seed: Improved hits identified by the first and second round of Booster screening are being prepared for resubmission to the Booster process (third iteration).4th Seed: Stopped.5th Seed: Hit series identified.6th Seed: Hit series identified.7th Seed: Compounds shipped to Institut Pasteur Korea.8th, 9th and 10th Seed: First iteration ongoing

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a serious healthcare issue being addressed on a global scale. NTDs are infections caused by parasites, bacteria and viruses which are mainly endemic in tropical areas of developing countries. It is estimated that over 1 billion people are affected worldwide by NTDs. Since these patients do not have enough access to needed medicine and healthcare, NTDs are not only a global health challenge but are said to be associated with poverty and affect economic growth in developing countries.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Astellas has initiated collaborative drug-discovery research to discover new drugs for the treatment of NTDs. This joint research aims for drug discovery for anti-protozoan and anti-dengue virus drug candidates. One consortium for anti-protozoan drug is in collaboration with DNDi, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Nagasaki University, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).
The target of the research are NTDs caused by parasitic protozoans, such as  leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and Sleeping sickness, which are without effective medicines for treatment and require the development of new therapeutic drugs. The other consortium for anti-dengue virus is in collaboration with Tokyo Institute of Technology and Nagasaki University. Astellas provides selected compounds for the evaluation. In addition, the consortiums utilize structure-based drug discovery by using the consortium's cutting-edge technologies, such as target discovery, information technology, and fragment evolution method.
Lessons learned 
This partnership highlights the importance of open innovation and collaboration with industry, academia, governmental organizations and NGOs. Integrating knowledge, technologies, and expertise has provided added values for research efficiency and quality to the consortium. Increased awareness of the consortium’s activity is anticipated.  For example, the number of collaborative research proposals from third parties have increased.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Initiated the screening of Astellas’ compound library.
Developed iNTRODB database for worldwide use.
The iNTRODB database already accelerated the NTDs reseach beyond the consortium.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In the aftermath of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, GSK is providing USD 133,509 of funding from June 2007 to June 2009 to help Sri Ramakrishna Math, a local NGO in the Chennai region of Tamil Nadu, to enroll an additional 420 local girls in its Nursing Training Course. Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai, in partnership with Direct Relief International, had already conducted extensive relief work in the area immediately after the tsunami, providing medicines, food, shelter and clothing.The impact of the tsunami in the coastal regions was significant, with an estimated 500 fatalities and 150,000 people displaced from their homes, which created a huge extra demand for trained health professionals. Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai developed its Nursing Assistant Training Course to help address staffing shortages and strengthen the local healthcare infrastructure as part of a long-term relief and rehabilitation strategy.The girls are selected from very poor, outlying agricultural and fishing villages. Many of them have completed their secondary schooling but, due to family financial restrictions, are unable to continue further. In most cases, they are the first in their families to receive higher education and the nurse training gives them hope of employment outside the depressed traditional fishing and agricultural industries.The success of the project is reflected in the high demand for their skills on completion of their training. The newly-qualified nurses have been quickly absorbed into nearby hospitals, where they are able to earn a decent salary and receive free room and board, thus raising their own economic status.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The SSA region accounts for only 0.3% of the world’s medical expenditure for cancer, though it accounts for 14% of the world population.
Approximately 95% of cancer patients in SSA are diagnosed at late- or end- stage disease, drastically reducing the chances of successful treatment.
The cancer fatality ratio (ratio of mortality to incidence) in SSA is high, estimated to be near 80%.
There is a shortage of cancer specialists in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. For instance, Kenya currently has 16 oncologists and 8 radiation specialists for a population in excess of 47 million people.
The cancer burden in SSA is predicted to increase by 85% from current levels by the year 2030. 

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership is dedicated to enhancing cancer care through training of health care practitioners who hold a Masters of Medicine in Internal Medicine. The practitioners will receive a formal certification in Medical Oncology on completion of the program.
 By addressing the shortages of Health Care Professionals in this field, will allow for a;
shift in country statistics from late- to early-stage cancer diagnosis
increase in the number of facilities offering access to cancer treatments
improvement in access to treatment

Summary of impact and forward looking information
This partnership aims to build capacity and ultimately create in Nairobi a Centre of Excellence for cancer in the SSA region. 
Once Nairobi is fully established as a centre of excellence for cancer care for the region and has achieved measurable success, the initiativess will be expanded into the other SSA countries.
Measurement of progress towards objectives
With approximately 40 000 new registered cases of cancers per year in Kenya alone and with the cancer burden expected to increase by 85% by 2030, the amount of patients who could ultimately be impacted by this partnership is significant.

                        The program provides nurses with training on the basics of cancer, the four main treatment modalities, patient support, and an introduction to palliative care, nursing care plans, care and maintenance of central venous access devices, and the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to provide care in a cancer unit.

            Nurses play an important role in cancer treatment delivery, symptom and pain management, and provide patients with information and much needed psychological support. There is a shortage of well-trained and qualified nurses in sub-Saharan Africa in both private and public sectors, and especially in oncology.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Cancer is an increasingly critical public health problem in the developing world. By 2020 it is expected that there will be 16 million new cases of cancer every year and that 70% of them will be in developing countries, which also have a much higher mortality rate compared with other regions due to more limited availability of screening, early detection, and access to treatment. Radiotherapy, for example, is available in just 21 out of 53 African nations.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2012, GSK co-funded, in collaboration with Partners in Health (PIH) and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, the first ever paediatric oncology congress in Rwanda where protocols were endorsed. To date, GSK has provided $376,998 to support PIH. The trainings also facilitate continued engagement in academic medicine and collective support of clinicians involved in cancer care within East Africa. To extend the reach of the project, the program focus is not just on training clinicians to provide care, but on providing training to other clinicians as well. It is expected that participants will train others at their home healthcare facilities about cancer care and curricula developed under this grant will be made available for use by other providers in East Africa. The trained clinicians work in the four oncology referral hospitals and healthcare facilities from all 42 district hospitals in Rwanda. Additionally, 48 laboratory technicians have received foundational training in histopathology tissue preparation and transfer. GSK will also continue to support the establishment of an oncology-specific training rotation for Residents at Butaro Hospital in Rwanda and the launching of in-service oncology training curriculum for district hospital nurses in 2014.

Lack of healthcare infrastructure is a key limiting factor in improving the health of communities in many parts of the world. In Rwanda, due to the terrain, it can take over three hours to navigate treacherous mountains to reach a health center. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GSK supports One Family Health to deliver an innovative health delivery model, bringing together One Family Health (OFH) Foundation and Ecobank, on one hand, and Healthstore Holdings (HSH) and the Rwandan Ministry of Health on the other. The aim of the program is to allow trained qualified nurses to own and operate their own healthcare clinics, and improve patients’ health knowledge.
Since the program was established in 2011, OFH has over 90 Health Posts across 11 districts in Rwanda. OFH is now looking to expand in Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia. This program allows local nurses to own and operate a basic medical clinic in rural areas of Rwanda, increasing access to high quality essential medicines and basic healthcare for 4% of Rwanda’s population, creating around 300 jobs and treating 309,592 patients.
This health post model, known as Child and Family Wellness (CFW) Health Posts, prevent and treat major causes of diseases and conditions in local communities, including malaria, diarrheal disease and respiratory infections.
The posts are run by experienced nurses providing an entry point into the formal Rwandan public health system and operating under a business format franchise network. This franchise model, which has been successfully piloted in Kenya, gives nurses joining the franchise access to finance and training in finance management, enabling them to earn a living while maintaining a secure supply of high-quality, affordable essential medicines in places where counterfeit and substandard drugs are common.

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Community health workers have been recognized for their success in reducing morbidity and averting mortality in mothers, newborns and children. These workers are most effective when supported by a clinically skilled health workforce, and deployed within the context of an appropriately financed primary health care system. However, they have proven crucial in settings where the overall primary health care system is weak. They also represent a strategic solution to address the growing realization that shortages of highly skilled health workers will not meet the growing demands of the rural population.
The campaign works with governments and aid agencies to finance and train the cadre of health workers, each of whom would serve a few hundred rural inhabitants, at a cost per year which falls within projected governmental health budgetary constraints and within the boundaries of donor assistance already pledged.
The campaign uses:
Point-of-care diagnostics to expand healthcare services in rural areas;
Scalable supervision through smartphones to link health workers to national health systems;
Standardized care set by rigorous guidelines to allow for the easy flow of treatment protocol;
Rapid training of healthcare workers without a large lag time between recruitment and deployment.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
There are significant unmet needs in the area of oral health in sub-Saharan Africa.
With economic growth, rural communities in Africa are increasingly exposed to western diets. Although nutritious, those diets are high in refined sugars, which have been shown to increase tooth decay and periodontal disease. With increased access to food and the changing diet, often the pattern of food intake changes which can predispose to increase in caries.
Oral diseases share many modifiable risk factors with the chronic diseases that are becoming more of a public health concern in Africa and the rest of the developing world.  Developing and testing behavioural change strategies to combat oral health problems not only fits well within the current implementation framework of GSK’s existing partnership with Millenium Villages Project, but it could also have synergistic effects in slowing the growth of other health problems. 
Poor oral hygiene and changed diets lead to increase in oral diseases. With increased prevalenceof tooth decay and periodontal disease, there is increased risk of oral infections spreading through the vascular system to other parts of the body causing, for example, heart diseases. Thus, preventionof oral diseases by implementation of oral hygiene programs is a good investment in oral and in general health.

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The oral health and hygiene pilot in the Millennium Villages consists of three distinct phases: 
The first includes planning and assessment, the second focuses on implementation and operational research, and the third on documenting findings and communicating them on a broader policy scale. Assessment is a critical piece of the initial planning of the study design, as there is less knowledge of and academic consensus on how to address oral health and hygiene in the developing world than was the case for the PHASE (Personal Hygiene & Sanitation Education) handwashing program. Moreover, it was critically important to ensure that the oral health component of the MVP was well integrated into the overall health strategy of the MVP.
The aim of the project is to:
Conduct a base-line study to map the status of oral health in two Millennium Villages sites and develop a set of oral health interventions appropriate for addressing these challenges.
Identify appropriate way of introducing these interventions and measuring their impact on oral health outcomes in rural settings.
Promote oral health as an essential part of the global health agenda (akin to profile of GSK’s PHASE – Personal Hygiene & Sanitation Education handwashing program).
Identify, test, cost and document the use and efficacy of various oral hygiene interventions in rural settings, for example, dental sticks, tooth brushing with toothpaste, etc.
Explore feasibility of community management of oral health.
Integrate oral hygiene intothe PHASE program as a key part of the curriculum which can be adapted to other PHASE countries. 
Expand treatment options in underserved rural settings.
Document lessons learned for national scale-up. Robust data collection and rigorous evaluation are essential for making the case for global policy change and national scale up programs.
Lessons learned      
In order to implement sustainable oral health behavioural and social interventions, it is imperative to include all sectors of the community in the base-line assessments. Therefore, community leaders, health care workers, teachers, youth organizations, parents, farmers, traders, and representatives from women’s associations were invited to participate in the focus groups, surveys and workshops.
Workshops were conducted to sensitize the community to oral health interventions, as well associal mobilization events to introduce capacity building and school program interventions. These focused on increasing awareness about good oral hygiene habits and proper brushing practices.
It was important to select schools that would implement daily supervised tooth brushing/ chewing stick use with a pre-and post-evaluation of defined outcomes.
In both Senegal and Ethiopia, all the focus groups acknowledged that oral problems in their village are widespread and severe; most thought that children were especially affected.
The focus groups also revealed a variety of local materials used for cleaning purposes as well as remedies for tooth pain and alternative traditional practices in both countries. In Ethiopia, for example, toothpaste was rarely used as it was believed to be a cause of bad breath and tooth pain.
Building the evidence for the impact of investment in oral health and hygiene is critical for national and international level scale-up of oral hygiene interventions. It will also allow the project to provide evidence-based technical support to more governments in developing countries in order to sustain behavioral and social interventions especially when resources are limited. Moreover, it will support advocacy efforts for the integration of oral health into global health. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The school program is being currently implemented in all Koraro Millennium Research Village elementary schools (Koraro, Tala and Tonsoka).
The total number of school children who are targeted and are receiving the oral health information sessions are 1186 students attending grades 1 to 8.
The project is making a significant impact on local and government stakeholders and has pioneered the use of mobile phones for the assessment of oral health needs in developing countries.
In Ethiopia and Senegal, the project has gained recognition at the national level. In Ethiopia, it led to the establishment of the Oral Health Task Force by the Ministry of Health and oral health is included in the Visioning Document for Health Care in Ethiopia 2020-2035.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Considering the dramatic rise in bacterial resistance worldwide, rational use of the MDR-TB compound delamanid is critical to ensuring that the greatest number of patients have access to this medicine over the longest period of time.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Otsuka launched a FighTBack initiative which has 4 parts:
1. Innovative Research and Development;
2. Responsible Access to Patients;
3. Optimized Patient Management;
4. Collaborative Capacity Building.
As part of the FighTBack initiative, Otsuka is participating in a number of collaborative studies. One of them is the endTB project led by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Partners in Health (PIH), and Interactive Research & Development (IRD). The endTB project will evaluate new regimens for the treatment of MDR-TB and reduce existing country-level barriers to the uptake of new TB drugs. Another study is called ""MDR-END"" led by the Seoul National University Hospital, looking at regimens that could shorten MDR-TB treatment. In December 2015 Otsuka provided a one-time donation of 400 treatment courses of delamanid to MSF for the endTB project in order to provide rapid access to patients in urgent need.
A key component of the initiative is also Otsuka's partnership with Stop TB Partnership's Global Drug Facility announced in February 2016, which enables about 100 eligible low- and middle-income countries to procure delamanid.  The Global Drug Facility is the largest procurer of quality-assured tuberculosis medicines and provides TB drug management technical assistance in an effort to promote equitable access to TB medicines and diagnostics.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
TB bacteria are so resilient that patients must take a regimen of several different medicines for anywhere from six months to a year. In the case of drug-resistant strains such as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), treatment can often last twice as long.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
As a recognized leader in TB R&D, Otsuka is committed to helping eliminate this devastating disease. For more than 30 years Otsuka has made TB research a priority, including strengthening clinical trial capacity and infrastructure in selected countries affected by TB. These investments have made Otsuka the current top private funder of TB drug development in the world.
In 2002, Otsuka experienced a breakthrough in its TB research with the discovery of delamanid, a nitroimidazole, which has subsequently received its first regulatory approval from the European Medicines Agency in 2014 as an oral treatment against adult pulmonary MDR-TB. Delamanid is the first from a new class of compounds that inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis with specificity to mycobacterium TB. Since 2015, it has been included in the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List.
The safety and efficacy of delamanid is currently undergoing further evaluation in several countries in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial. The trial includes six months of treatment with delamanid as part of a full course of treatment with an optimized background regimen (OBR) and includes HIV co-infected MDR-TB patients.
Additionally, the company has initiated a paediatric investigation plan consisting of open-label, multi-center PK and safety trials of delamanid in children with MDR-TB in four groups of descending age from less than 18 years to birth. For the youngest groups, a novel child-friendly dispersible formulation of delamanid is being used. The studies are taking place in the Philippines and South Africa.
Since 2005, Otsuka provided over USD 450 million in funding. Delamanid received its first regulatory approval from the European Medicines Agency in 2014 for use in adult patients with pulmonary MDR-TB.

                        The partnership involves refining and updating the national palliative care training curriculum for non-communicable diseases and other life-threatening illnesses. It will convert the national curriculum into e- and m-learning content and use it to train healthcare professionals and community health workers. It will also involve developing and maintaining a digital data collection, storage, access control, data security and management system for palliative care.

            Sub-Saharan Africa is facing a staggering NCD burden which is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. There is an urgent need for high-quality and culturally-relevant palliative care services in the public healthcare system across the region, especially for cancer patients. 

            The program aims to train at least 800 Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and 500 Community Health Workers (CHWs), which will translate into improved care for over 100,000 patients and family members. 
The curriculum and its content have been developed, aligned with government policy, certified through relevant national and governmental procedures, and over 800 HCPs and CHWs trained so far.

Uganda currently ranks 161 out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index and is one of the most underdeveloped countries in the world. Access to healthcare services is a challenge, particularly for the little-understood Nodding Syndrome. This progressive neurological disease mostly affects children aged 5-15 and is characterised by head nodding, diminished mental capacities and stunted growth.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2014, AbbVie has partnered with Medical Teams International in the District of Pader, Uganda to treat this rare disease and improve quality of life for more than 320 patients. As a result of treatment, 90 children have been able to return to school. The organization works closely with the Ugandan Ministry of Health to provide direct services, including prenatal care, immunization, HIV counseling and malaria treatment. 30 health workers have been trained on how to deal with patients with Nodding Syndrome. To date, 2820 bottles of medication for the prevention and treatment of Nodding Syndrome has been donated by AbbVie to treat adolescents in Uganda.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
What began as a pilot program in Romania in 1995 has since become one of the world's largest university-based program dedicated to pediatric HIV-AIDS care globally, providing care in six African countries and Romania.
Early in the program, the main challenge was proving that children living with HIV could be provided with and adhere to high quality care and treatment in resource-poor settings and show positive measurable results. The pilot project in the Romanian clinic that led to the development of the BIPAI model addressed this challenge, and deaths among children declined from 15 percent to 1 percent, providing the first proof of concept for offering large-scale effective HIV treatment to children in a limited resource setting. 
BIPAI has now treated over 300,000 pediatric AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa and trained 52,000 health care professionals and is credited as the leading force behind reducing the number of pediatric AIDS cases in Africa from 650,000 in 2003 to less than 150,000 today.
Additionally, the Malawi and Romania Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) program combines all the medical and psychosocial services provided at the clinic as well as community resources in order to achieve prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child.
The partnership between AbbVie and the AbbVie Foundation and BIPAI began in 2000 (AbbVie and AbbVie Foundation assumed the partnership following AbbVie’s separation from Abbott in 2013) with $25 million in cash grants and $30 million in product donations made to-date. Today BIPAI treats more than 300,000 children in over a dozen countries and remains one of the largest provider of pediatric HIV care and treatment in the world while continuing to expand its treatment of other conditions impacting the health and well-being of children and families worldwide.
Lessons learned                         
Despite prior lack of evidence that children with HIV/AIDS can be effectively cared for and treated in the developing world, this model program and its network of clinics are now successfully treating over 300,000 children, adolescents and their families living with HIV/AIDS.
Partnerships with governments, multilateral organizations, foundations and other donors are key to scaling-up and sustaining programs.
A long-term commitment and perspective are key to overcoming setbacks and enjoying successes in complex and large efforts, like helping BIPAI build and replicate its model in multiple countries.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
BIPAI Children's Clinical Centers of Excellence Network now treats over 300,000 children, adolescents and their family members - the largest number of children with HIV in any treatment program worldwide.
75% of patients in Romania on ART have adherence of >95%, 80% of patients on ART in Malawi have adherence of greater than 95%.
Programs have increased awareness regarding prevention HIV at the community level by 30%.
Since 2004, AbbVie Foundation invested more than $12 million in Malawi to renovate two paediatric wards, and open a new paediatric haematology/oncology unit.
Providing core funding has been critical to supporting BIPAI Network operations supporting 6 African countries and Romania.

Malaria is estimated to kill close to 900,000 people each year with the majority of deaths occurring in children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In December 2010, MSD* announced a partnership with the NYU Langone Medical Center and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). The collaboration focuses on creating a vaccine that prevents an essential early stage of malaria infection: the invasion of the malaria parasite into the human liver. The partnership leverages MSD's own expertise along with the NYU Langone Medical Center's extensive research into malaria and MVI's critical funding resources.
The researchers working on this project are focusing on a new approach that targets a region of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) important to a critical function of the protein. By blocking this function, researchers hope they invasion of the parasite into the liver, an essential step in causing malaria disease, can be prevented.
Although this vaccine approach intended primarily for use in children younger than one year of age, it could be used to help prevent disease in all populations vulnerable to Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly species of the parasite, and could potentially be adapted to prevent Plasmodium vivax as well.
Lessons learned                             
By partnering with a leading university laboratory with deep expertise in malaria biology and a non-for-profit R&D organization such as MVI, MSD scientists are able to make meaningful contributions towards developing a novel malaria vaccine from the concept stage to potential vaccine candidates.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The fight against cancer is far from over. Significant progress has been made, but progress is not fast enough and does not reach every patient.
This progress is sometimes discounted because it has generally occurred in small steps. Science, medicine and industry have moved forward against cancer not by discovering outright cures in most cases, but by building on existing knowledge and treatments in a series of innovative steps – what is called “continuous innovation.” New treatments or treatment combinations that extend patients’ average survival by a few months are an example of continuous innovation. Over time, this pattern has led to much better outcomes for patients.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
PACE is a collaboration across international borders and among diverse stakeholders-including industry, academia, payers, and patient groups. PACE acts as a network of networks: to create wider awareness of what is being done to speed innovations to the patients who need them, to help coordinate existing work, and to avoid duplication of effort and waste of resources. 
The purpose of the Council is to:
Provide a forum for intellectual exchange and for linkage between existing initiatives led by its members.
Recommend actions consistent with the goals of PACE to devise or encourage policy reforms.
Improve public awareness on cancer-related issues.
PACE and the participants in the PACE Global Council are mutually independent but come together voluntarily under the shared goal of speeding cancer innovations to the patients who need them.
2015
PACE Continuous Innovation Indicators™ (CII) was launched in 2015. It is a tool that visualises progress against cancer over time and will provide a better understanding of the value of cancer treatments and of the potential impact of policy reforms on the speed of innovation. The tool will permit objective comparisons, initially against 12 tumor types: breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin (melanoma), stomach, rectum and testes.
2014
PACE launched eMEET (Medicine Evaluation Educational Training), a new online training program designed to help patient advocates better influence decisions related to access to new medicines.
PACE released The PACE Clinical Trials Review, a six-nation qualitative survey of cancer patients and caregivers.
PACE encouraged constructive dialogue around the value of continuous innovation through op eds, joint editorials, speeches and other venues. One of the PACE-led editorials was referred to during the ASCO 2014 opening address.
PACE sponsored the “Value Footprint” study published by the London-based Office of Health Economics (OHE).
PACE sponsored the global “Values and Standards for Patient Engagement in HTA”.

                        This patient assistance program enables eligible Malaysian patients to complete their course of treatment with Adcetris®, even if they cannot afford to pay for it in full. It is adapted to Malaysia's mixed system of private and public care, and has been developed with the agreement of the government of Malaysia. It is based on a confidential means-based assessement, conducted by an independent, third party organization, that determines how many vials of treatment the patient will need to pay for, and how many will be covered by Takeda and other parties.

            Before the launch of Adcetris® there were no treatment options for Malaysian patients with RR HL or RR sALCL.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In China there is limited reimbursement of biologic medicines and a nascent health insurance market, so the majority of patients have to pay out-of-pocket. In addition, physicians often do not prescribe targeted treatments, such as Herceptin (trastuzumab) for treating HER2-postive breast and gastric cancer, due to low quality HER2 testing and suboptimal duration of treatment as patients cannot afford to stay on treatment.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In collaboration with the Cancer Foundation in China and the Ministry of Health, Roche launched a patient assistance program (PAP) in August 2011 to address affordability. Under the program, after a patient has taken the first six cycles of Herceptin treatment, Roche donates the next eight cycles through the Cancer Foundation so that patients complete the full course of treatment.
Roche also supports patient education programs on breast cancer, offered by the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association, to increase awareness of disease and the importance of early diagnosis, and collaborate with the pathologist’s association to improve HER2 testing quality.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
Before these programs, less than 15% of people in China with HER2-positive breast cancer received Roche's targeted treatment. Today, this integrated approach of disease awareness, HER2 testing and affordability assistance has doubled the number of people not only receiving treatment, but receiving the full duration of treatment, enabling better health outcomes.
Over 40,000 patients now have access to Herceptin through Roche's patient assistance programme in China.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Of the 2.5 million HIV-positive children in the world in 2007, nearly 90% were in sub-Saharan Africa, according to UNAIDS. Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are developed for adults, most clinical trials are in adults, with doses and dosage forms designed for adults. But children cannot be dosed like small adults, as their metabolic capacity to absorb ARVs is not simply proportional to their weight. Safety, efficacy and dosage need to be determined via specific pediatric trials. Most ARVs were developed in tablet form, yet these are impractical for children under five, who require special liquid formulations. While older children can take tablets, those intended for adults often contain too large a dose.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This partnership researches and develops new medicines and/or new formulations of existing medicines to treat children with HIV/AIDS, especially in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In some cases, partners have signed licensing, patent and/or technology transfer agreements with generic drug manufacturers in South Africa, India and Brazil to make existing HIV/AIDS medicines available in developing countries at lower costs.
AbbVie, first as Abbott, has a long-standing commitment to the treatment of children with HIV. In 2007, AbbVie (as Abbott) launched the first lower-strength tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir in the developing world (Uganda) before making the product available in developed countries. The lopinavir/ritonavir tablet is the only co-formulated protease inhibitor tablet that can be used in children (generic versions of this tablet formulation have been made available subsequent to 2007). The tablets do not require refrigeration and can be taken with or without a meal, an important advance in delivering HIV medicine in developing countries. The tablet is easier for children to take than its liquid formulation, which has been used in Africa since 2001. The lower-strength tablet is sold at half the price of the original formulation in 69 countries, including all of Africa.  AbbVie is developing a sprinkle formulation of norvir, suitable for use in children living with HIV. The new powder has no alcohol or propylene glycol, has significantly improved shelf life from the liquid formulation currently in use, and will not require refrigeration.
Bristol-Myers Squibb produces pediatric formulations of Videx® (didanosine), Zerit® (stavudine) and Sustiva® (efavirenz) and works with the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group to develop Reyataz® (atazanavir) for infants from 3 months old to 18 years. Sustiva capsules are currently approved for use in children 3 years and older. Sustiva is currently approved in the US for treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other ARVs in adults and children 3 months or older who weigh at least 3.5 kg and for patients 3 years and older in other parts of the world.  Bristol-Myers Squibb has studied a capsule sprinkle approach to dosing of Sustiva in children 3 months of age and older. For more information about Bristol-Myers Squibb’s initiatives to expand access to medicines for people with HIV/AIDS and people in developing countries click here. 
Since 2009, GlaxoSmithKline's ARV interests have been managed by ViiV Healthcare, a new HIV company founded with the singular purpose of research and development of HIV treatments. ViiV Healthcare has developed a number of ARV liquid formulations for children, all available at access prices in the world's poorest countries. ViiV Healthcare has also committed to support multiple paediatric clinical trials in resource-poor countries to determine the best ways to expand access to HIV/AIDS treatment..
In 2010 ViiV Healthcare announced a partnership with Clinton Access Health Initiative (CHAI) and Mylan Laboratories to develop the fixed dose combinations abacavir/lamivudine for the treatment of infants and children. In this innovative partnership ViIV Healthcare, Mylan and CHAI worked to bring respective expertise to develop a taste masked and dispersible product that was deemed of high clinical significance. In 2013, the WHO highlighted ABC/3TC as a key medicine for the treatment of infants and children. ViiV Healthcare conducted the technical development of the product and provided finance and project management support for Mylan to develop and file the product. Mylan filed the product with the FDA in October 2013.
Recognising that 66% of the over 3 million children living with HIV worldwide do not have access to appropriate care and medicines, ViiV Healthcare has granted royalty-free voluntary licences for paediatric formulations of its existing and pipeline HIV medicines (including Dolutegravir), in order to ensure that children in all least-developed, all low-income, and all sub-Saharan African countries (where 99% of all children with HIV live) are able to receive high-quality, low-cost medicines.
ViiV Healthcare also supports collaborative research trials in resource-poor settings to understand public health issues such as prevention of mother-to-child HIVtransmission and HIV-TB co-infection. In total, at the end of 2012, 93 clinical trials were underway; 14 of the 93 trials are paediatric studies. African countries participating in the paediatric studies include Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
As part of its ongoing work to deliver innovation in paediatric HIV treatment and care, ViiV Healthcare established a £10 million Paediatric Innovation Seed Fund. This fund specifically supports partnerships with organizations that focus on the evidence base for paediatric care and treatment, the research and development of paediatric fixed-dose combination (FDC) products, and formulations for the treatment of infants and children living with HIV. Examples of partnerships developed to improve access to treatment and care include:
The ViiV Healthcare-Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation Partnership to increase early detection of HIV and improve access to antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive infants and young children; strengthen government leadership and policies around paediatric HIV/AIDS; and improve the quality and use of paediatric care to advance the effectiveness of its services.
The ViiV Healthcare-amfAR TREAT Asia program to optimize the quality of healthcare for infants and children living with HIV across Asia through the development of clinical data to support optimal paediatric treatment guidelines.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Child mortality is a prevalent problem in Africa where, in most countries, more than 100 children out of a thousand die before their first birthday. In Mali, 1 child out of 5 does not reach the age of 5.
This is not due to major epidemics but, in 70 % of cases, to diseases that can very easily be treated if detected early enough. It is unacceptable since affordable treatment and staff qualified to treat those diseases are available locally.
Malaria, pneumonia and diarrheal diseases together account for 55% of children deaths in Africa (60% in Mali).
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Sanofi Espoir Foundation has partnered the association Djantoli (formerly Pesinet) which has developed an innovative concept of providing access to primary healthcare for children up to five years old, using mobile and internet technologies. 
For a small monthly fee, families voluntarily enroll their children in a comprehensive health service. Subscribing families benefit from :
Regular home visits: a Djantoli agent regularly visits families at their homes to examine children and collect simple health data (weight, fever, signs of cough, number of stools…, etc.) and offer personnalized health and nutrition advice ;
Remote medical monitoring : the agent transfers the collected data to the doctor of the nearest health center thanks to a mobile application. Every day, the doctor reviews the data and calls in children at risk ;
Family alert : when a child is called in, the agent immediately goes back to the family to warn the mother and ask her to rapidly bring her child to the health center ;
Health insurance : when mothers bring their child to the health center, they pay only a fraction of the medical costs ;
Educational talks : each month, collective talks are organized on various topics (diarrhea, malaria, breastfeeding, etc.) to raise mothers’ awareness and help them improve their health practices.
A mobile phone application enables community health workers to collect and send data to a database that can be monitored remotely in real-time by the local doctor.
A ‘mutualized’ health insurance system pays for this service. For less than one euro per month, families can afford regular health examinations for their children by the association workers, and free medical consultation in case of anomalies detected remotely by the doctor, together with discounted medicines to treat the child and free follow-up consultations if necessary.
While Djantoli aims to keep the price of the service affordable to low-income families, asking for a financial contribution is key to the success of the project. Not only does it contribute to its financial sustainability, but it engages families in a new way. It encourages them to use the service they paid for, and, as customers, it gives them to right to demand good quality of service.
This project improves health monitoring of children, and educates families about prevention and early care. It is a break away from a free-assistance approach in the healthcare area; free care has shown little impact on mortality rates in the last 20 years.
Lessons learned
Most children and mothers die of benign diseases for which affordable treatment exists. Overall, more than half deaths could be avoided with frequent prevention, efficient detection of abnormalities and provision of adapted basic treatment in time.By providing non expensive health insurance, which includes prevention, early-detection service and facilitate access to early treatment, childhood mortality is likely to reduce significantly.The association services are a full part of the local healthcare environment. Djantoli defines itself as a public service partner that strengthens existing public health policies and community structures.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The service runs in Mali and Burkina Faso. Key achievements include:  
94% satisfaction rate among subscriber families
Djantoli subscribers use care resources three times more than the average local children 
More than 6,000 children have benefitted from the service
3 500 mothers followed education sessions on health practices

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in Africa, and a very important one in terms of public health burden and economic impact. Left untreated, this poverty-related disease can lead to anemia, stunted growth and impaired learning ability, and chronic inflammation of the organs, which can be fatal in the most serious cases.
As efforts focus on morbidity control and elimination, there is a pressing need to treat preschool children (under 6 years old). No suitable drug formulation is made available for this high-risk group, which accounts for about 10% of the 220 million people already infected.
The existing ‘gold standard’ treatment for schistosomiasis is praziquantel (PZQ), which was developed in the 1970s. This oral anthelmintic is available as generic drug and currently donated through the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program, via the World Health Organization (WHO), to fight schistosomiasis in Africa. It is safe and effective, and a tablet formulation is available for adults and school-age children but not for those below 6 years of age.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium was founded in July 2012 as the first international, non-profit, public-private partnership in schistosomiasis, supported by world leading experts in tropical parasitic infectious diseases. The Consortium aims to develop, register and provide access to a pediatric praziquantel formulation for treating schistosomiasis in preschool-age children, with proven efficacy and safety and acceptable taste properties. The formulation should also withstand the challenges presented by a tropical climate.
Two novel PZQ formulation candidates have been developed by the Consortium: a racemic mixture and an enantiopure version, both with improved taste properties.
The new formulation candidates are a quarter of the size of the current approved PZQ Cesol® 600 mg tablet. Because they are orodispersible, they can be dispersed in water and administered to younger children, infants and toddlers. Both formulation candidates are currently in clinical Phase II testing.
The Consortium fully supports the WHO objective of eliminating schistosomiasis as a global health problem and is building a sustainable partnership through working with credible and experienced partners:
Merck (Germany) leads the program and provides expertise and support relating to PZQ, including internal resources from different areas needed for clinical development: drug product manufacturing; preclinical; clinical and regulatory. The Consortium is governed by a Board which consists of top management representatives from each partner.
Astellas Pharma Inc. (Japan) has developed the new pediatric PZQ formulations, and provides expert advice on clinical development in children, and pharmacokinetic modeling.
Lygature, a Dutch not-for-profit foundation, acts as the independent coordinator of the Consortium, providing governance in terms of progress, finance and collaboration. Since 2006, Lygature has supported close to a hundred public-private partnerships in the field of life sciences & health, including poverty-related diseases.
Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute is a not-for-profit Institute internationally renowned for its research, services, teaching and training in global heath. It contributes with extensive experience in helminths biological and pharmacological research; epidemiology; and clinical research in endemic regions.
Farmanguinhos, the federal governmental pharmaceutical laboratory of the Fiocruz Foundation in Brazil, brings unique expertise to addressing the production and distribution of new pediatric formulations in endemic countries
SimCYP, a UK-based research company, provides pharmacokinetics modeling capabilities and expertise.
The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) at Imperial College London, with a 15-year-experience in providing treatments against schistosomiasis and three soil-transmitted helminths to the rural poor in Sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen, facilitates preparation and implementation of the Access and Delivery plan in schistosomiasis endemic countries, to ensure optimal use for the new pediatric praziquantel formulation.
In addition, apart from in-kind contributions by the partners and a cash contribution by Merck, the Consortium has been supported by grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded in 2013, and from the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, awarded in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
Lessons learned       
The Consortium has addressed many scientific, regulatory and access challenges in the area of global health through working as a team with all consortium partners and involving pharmaceutical, (non-)clinical, clinical and regulatory experts in the field of pediatric medicine and schistosomiasis at key stages of the development process. The Consortium also actively explores opportunities to extend the partnership into endemic countries (and the partnership with Farmanguinhos in Brazil is an example) as it will contribute to building capacity in those countries.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since its implementation in July 2012, the consortium has accomplished the following: 
Preclinical package completed with no toxicity issues reported.
Process development and manufacturing of GMP material for Phase I and II completed.
ODT (orally disintegrating tablet) formulations developed and optimized.
Tech Transfers of the pediatric formulation processes, involving Consortium partners (Astellas, Merck and Farmanguinhos) to produce GMP batches for the clinical supplies, were completed.
Target Product Profile (TPP), clinical development program and initial regulatory strategy defined together with experts from endemic countries. 
Meetings with regulators held. 
TPP reviewed at the WHO NTD Informal consultation meeting on treatment of Schistosomiasis in preschool-age children and pediatric Praziquantel formulations (September 2015), resulting in only minor amendments.
Two Phase I bioavailability studies in healthy volunteers (South Africa) completed; the two new pediatric formulations well tolerated.
A swill-and spit taste study with school-age children (Tanzania) completed; both formulations were significantly more palatable than the commercial PZQ tablets.
Phase II study in S.Mansoni (schistosomiasis)-infected pre-school children implemented in Ivory Coast to assess the efficacy and safety of two orodispersible tablet formulations.
Grants from two international global health funds awarded to the Consortium to finance the program

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
The International Diabetes Federation estimates the adult prevalence of diabetes in China is 9.8%, compared with a worldwide estimate of 8.8%.  A 2013 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found adult prevalence of diabetes in China of 11.6%, about 113.9 million adults.
Effective management of diabetes and other chronic diseases requires high-quality primary care and specialty care, as neeed; support for daily, self-management of the disease, and attention to psychosocial and mental health conditions that may complicate disease management.  Integration of these various important elements of effective diabetes care and management is challenging.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
The Merck Foundation has committed US$781,000 over three years (2016-2018) to support the UNC School of Public Health, in collaboration with its implementing partners, in developing, implementing and evaluating a peer support (e.g., community health worker) program in 10 Community Health Centers in Shanghai to help improve diabetes self-management, treatment adherence, and quality of life among people living with diabetes. 
The peer support program will be combined with the ongoing Shanghai Integration Model (SIM) that integrates the care provided by specialty/tertiary hospitals and primary/community health centers to help improve patterns of care and clinical outcomes. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
UNC School of Public Health and its partners will develop and implement a rigorous program evaluation.  Outcomes will be evaluated at each of these levels in 10 Community Health Centers: 
Patterns of care, including attendance at regular care, follow through with referral to specialty care, and perceptions of patients as well as primary and specialty care providers about continuing needs for integration of care. 
Components of care, including medication adherence as well as key aspects of disease self-management, such as healthy diet, physical activity etc. 
Ultimately, the partnership aims to extend the combined SIM and peer support to Community Health Centers throughout Shanghai and share the results of this program throughout China in partnership with the Chinese Diabetes Society.
Measurement of progress towards objectives: 
The partnership was initiated in late 2016.  Preliminary evaluation results are anticipated in late 2019.

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Partnership for Pediatric AIDS Treatment was launched in 2006. This public-private partnership includes research-based and generic pharmaceutical companies and multilateral organizations such as UNAIDS, WHO and UNICEF. The initiative will identify scientific obstacles to treatment for children, take practical steps to address key barriers, share best practices and develop systems for clinical and technical support.
PEPFAR’s program strategy emphasizes improving health outcomes, increasing program sustainability and integration, and strengthening health systems.
In addition to making medicines available at preferential prices to PEPFAR, Abbott is working with PEPFAR to advance treatment for children with HIV in developing countries by actively participating in the PEPFAR Partnership for Pediatric AIDS Treatment. Abbott also is engaged in helping to advance Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) for detecting HIV in infants in resource limited settings. Additional initiatives include efforts to facilitate registration harmonization, such as between countries in Africa and the Caribbean.
Bristol-Myers Squibb is an active partner in the PEPFAR Partnership for Pediatric AIDS Treatment, working to find solutions to issues concerning pediatric HIV treatment, formulations and access. In 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to allow the FDA to make right of reference to its confidential dossiers and product registration files to facilitate approval of generic combination products under the PEPFAR program.
ViiV Healthcare is a supplier of ARVs to PEPFAR at access prices and has also participated in the State Department's program to expand the number of pediatric formulations for HIV medicines that are appropriate for PEPFAR and other child access programs in the developing world.

MSD* works in partnership with the PEPFAR Partnership for Pediatric AIDS Treatment to identify scientific and technical solutions to improve access to antiretroviral treatment for children living with HIV in resource-limited settings.
Lessons learned
The global HIV/AIDS epidemic requires a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach that expands access to prevention, care and treatment. As PEPFAR works to build upon its successes, it will focus on transitioning from an emergency response to promoting sustainable country programs.
Sustainable programs must be country-owned and country-driven. Given that the AIDS epidemic represents a shared global burden among nations, the next phase of PEPFAR represents an opportunity for the United States to support shared responsibility with partner countries. To seize this opportunity, PEPFAR is supporting countries in taking leadership of the responses to their epidemics. In addition, to support an expanded collective impact at the country level, PEPFAR is increasing collaboration with multilateral organizations.
Sustainable programs must address HIV/AIDS within a broader health and development context. PEPFAR must be responsive to the overall health needs faced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), their families, and their communities, linking the HIV response to a diverse array of global health challenges. As a component of the Global Health Initiative, PEPFAR will be carefully and purposefully integrated with other health and development programs.
Integration expands country capacity to address a broader array of health demands and to respond to new and emerging challenges presented by HIV. Strategic coordination furthers the reach of bilateral assistance, leverages the work of multilateral organizations, promotes country ownership, and increases the sustainability of national health programs.
Sustainable programs must build upon strengths and increase efficiencies. PEPFAR is renewing its emphasis on a ""whole of government"" response, ensuring that agencies focus on core competencies and better coordination to maximize the effectiveness of U.S. Government (USG) assistance. It is also identifying and implementing efficiencies in its work at both field and headquarters levels to ensure value for money. To build upon the strengths of proven programs, PEPFAR is scaling up effective interventions, particularly in prevention. Finally, it is working to ensure that increased access to coverage is accompanied by an emphasis on quality of services.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
As of September 30, 2014, PEPFAR is supporting life-saving antiretroviral treatment for 7.7 million men, women, and children (of which, 4.5 million are receiving direct support and an additional 3.2 million are benefiting from essential technical support to partner countries) and provided care and support for more than 5 million orphans and vulnerable children.
PEPFAR also directly supported HIV counseling and testing for more than 56.7 million people in fiscal year 2014, providing a critical entry point to prevention, treatment, and care.
PEPFAR is currently supporting training for more than 140,000 new health care workers in PEPFAR-supported countries to deliver HIV and other health services.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In 2007, 85% of people in AMPATH’s catchment area of then 1.8 million people did not know their HIV status. In remote areas programs needed to find less expensive and more effective means of keeping those who were HIV-positive from progressing to advanced disease and death as well as work “upstream” to provide intervention before HIV-positive patients became gravely ill. Testing people before they are obviously ill—and before they have infected their partners—will move more infected people into treatment earlier, when the treatment can be most effective and prevent thousands of people from becoming HIV-positive in the first place. The UNAIDS “90-90-90” strategy (i.e. >90% of those with HIV found; >90% on ART; >90% with viral suppression) requires a shift to a rapid testing strategy where counselors can cover targeted, high prevalence communities within months rather than years, testing and finding all HIV positive individuals as soon as possible.
Additionally, to better meet the health needs of people in their catchment area, AMPATH has been transforming its HIV care system into an integrated health care system inclusive of the treatment and control of HIV but also addressing issues of maternal, newborn, and child health as well as chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
AMPATH has developed a Perpetual Home-based Counseling and Testing (PHCT) program which allows PHCT counselors to offer door-to-door counseling and testing and linkage to care and treatment. The model reduces loss to follow up, leads to less expensive, more effective treatment and reduces the level of community viral load to markedly diminish HIV transmission within the community. With PHCT, AMPATH has better knowledge of HIV prevalence, can monitor the impact of its interventions, help reduce the loss to follow up and can ensure care and treatment for the long term.  The use of simple technologies including solar power and cell phones with GPS systems brings health care directly to people’s homes rather than requiring them to go to a hospital or clinic – often a hardship for those without access to transportation. AMPATH brought Africa’s first operational model of care structured to halt the HIV pandemic comprehensively. Evidence underlines that aggressive efforts to Find, Link, Treat and Retain (FLTR) all HIV-infected persons in a population holds the promise of lowering the prevalence of HIV/AIDS substantially.
As of 2016 the partnership has reached over 1,500,000 people.  The percentage of individuals already in care among those who know their HIV status increased from 93.8% in 2014 to 99.3% in 2016.
PHCT counselors can also screen for tuberculosis, test for diabetes and blood pressure, treat children for intestinal worms, screen for cervical cancer, provide nutritional counseling and record household data in a handheld device which is then synced with the AMPATH electronic medical records system (AMRS), linking patients to care.
AMPATH’s electronic medical record system now holds the largest clinical data repository in Africa and is active in over 40 countries worldwide. The system has become one of the electronic record systems of choice in a number of African countries, including Kenya. AMPATH is now poised to fully deploy the electronic medical record system throughout its model of population-based primary care. Key new features enable it to: 
Capture all clinical encounters into a single repository (e.g. in home or clinic; nutritionist or clinician)
Transition to a paperless point-of-care capture of clinical encounters
Assure point-of-care clinical decision support for clinical providers to enhance best practices
Assure Ministry of Health access and ownership of data at each major clinic.
Intensive outreach by counselors also seeks to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, address food and income insecurity and build self-sufficiency through skills training and health education workshops. Critical maternal neonatal child health services and chronic disease management are supported by a network of speciality care extending from County Hospital to National Referral Hospital.  Income and food security are strengthened by an extensive network of village based groups capable of a full range of small loans and micro-enterprise training. Kenya’s National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) will utilize this care system as a demonstration of health insurance for the informal (unemployed) segment of society.
The partnership has also helped:
Launch Kenya’s first primary care insurance coverage for individuals who are employed in the informal sector (e.g. subsistence farmers, small independent shop owners, etc.). AMPATH will serve as the delivery network for a capitated insurance product sponsored by the NHIF. This product will be scaled, as needed, to keep pace with the entire catchment served by this evolving model of population-based primary care.
Certify Advanced Practice Clinical Officers (APCO): These non-physician providers have demonstrated the capacity to manage high volume clinics with very complex patients in remote resource limited settings. In the HIV component of the AMPATH/MOH program, APCOs provide more than 95 percent of the care. Now, these same clinical officers are adding to their responsibilities the care of non-communicable chronic diseases. AMPATH is working with the Government of Kenya and national certifying agencies to recognize the advanced capacities of these clinical officers and to establish national curricula and more appropriate compensation packages and career advancement opportunities for them.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
It has been estimated that in the next two decades nearly three quarters of newly diagnosed cancer will occur in Low Income Countries (LICs). Cancer is now the number one cause of premature death in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, specifically, according to 2008 GLOBOCAN estimates there were roughly 22,000 deaths due to cancer and for a child born that year, the likelihood of developing cancer prior to age 75 was 14%. Currently, the resources available for cancer patients in Kenya are inadequate to deal with the present or predicted rise in the burden of this disease. For example, only two radiation facilities currently exist in Kenya and there is a particular need to develop an adequately trained workforce.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
AMPATH (Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare) is an organizational construct led by the Indiana University School of Medicine in partnership with Moi University School of Medicine, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and a consortium of North American universities and medical centers operating in partnership with United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It takes a systems-based approach, providing comprehensive clinical care, prevention, health promotion, research, and training in Western Kenya. In 2009, Pfizer began supporting AMPATH’s efforts to develop a Center of Excellence in Oncology, an optimal physical structure and a comprehensive oncology program which focuses on developing cost-conscious and sustainable chemotherapy regimens, radiation therapy and continued education and training and clinical trials and research support groups. This model builds on the foundation of the primary care and HIV/AIDS model AMPATH implements.
From 2011 – 2013, Pfizer also partnered with AMPATH through its Global Health Fellows program, the company’s skills-based volunteer program.  Three Global Health Fellows were successful in working with AMPATH to assess and increase the efficiency of the organization’s drug management system, to improve drug procurement and stock management and to ensure the integrity of the drug supply chain.  
Summary of impact and forward looking information
With Pfizer’s support to date, AMPATH has been able to treat hundreds of cancer patients who otherwise would not have received curative or palliative treatment. The 2011-2012 goal of the program is to establish a cancer and chronic care facility which would provide both adequate space for administration, screening, treatment (including chemotherapy and radiation services) and palliative care. The facility will house hematology-oncology clinics, chemotherapy administration, radiation therapy and screening for breast and cervical cancers. The AMPATH Oncology program recognizes that a major component of sustainability lies upon its ability to train a Kenyan workforce to meet the immense needs of the cancer burden. A curriculum is in the late stages in development for Gyne-Oncology and AMPATH is working to expand this to hematology-oncology practitioners and nurses.

At Pfizer we believe that access to quality healthcare and the opportunity to lead healthy lives is an extremely important social goal.  The power and value of collaboration between public and private organizations in achieving that goal cannot be overstated.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The International Trachoma Initiative: Since 1998 Pfizer has donated 500 million doses of azithromycin to the International Trachoma Initiative (ITI), a part of the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET 2020), to help in the fight against blinding trachoma. This Alliance is a unique collaboration of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector partners implementing a WHO-recommended strategy called “SAFE” that combines:
a)       Surgery to treat the blinding stage of the disease,
b)       Antibiotics to treat infection,
c)       Facial cleanliness to help reduce transmission, and
d)       Environmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation. 
The Diflucan Partnership:  First launched in South Africa in 2000, the Diflucan Partnership Program started as a 2-year program but was later expanded to developing countries across the globe. From providing face-to-face training and distributing program materials to healthcare professionals to help improve patient management and medicine distribution, to developing online training modules to support the diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis and esophageal candidiasis; prevention treatment of AIDS-related opportunistic infection is often a crucial part of care for people living with HIV and AIDS.
Since 2000, the Diflucan Partnership Program has donated over 106 million fluconazole treatments with a total value of more than $1.8 billion to more than 6,000 sites in 63 countries across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America.

The program aims to prevent initial infection by developping new vaccines. This will consequently reduce antibiotic use and the spread of AMR. 

                        

            

            

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Pfizer has made significant and substantial investments in vaccine R&D to develop new vaccines and to support several vaccines already in clinical usage.  It has been clearly demonstrated that bacterial vaccines significantly reduce AMR by preventing infection in the first place thus reducing the need to use antibiotics. In addition, bacterial vaccines if and when used to immunize large sections of a population also reduce the spread of AMR bacteria in the community through herd immunity.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Pfizer Vaccines in Late – Stage Development
In 2015, Pfizer began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial of our investigational Staphylococcus aureus vaccine, designed to prevent this widespread but increasingly drug-resistant bacterium. In addition, enrolment is complete in the Phase 2 program for the Pfizer Clostridium difficile vaccine, aimed at the bacteria responsible for nearly a half million infections resulting in 29,000 US deaths in 2011. Prevention would reduce this disease impact and the need to treat the infections with antibiotics hence reducing overall antibiotic use. Both of these vaccine candidates have received Fast Track designation from the FDA
Pfizer Vaccines in Early – Stage Development
In early stage development is a vaccine for protection against Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Treatment guidelines advise that GBS-colonized women should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent GBS disease in the neonate. Up to a million plus women each year are treated in this fashion.  The potential impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on both the microbiome of the newborn and the emergence of AMR is unknown; however, a vaccine against GBS would reduce the need for prophylactic antibiotic use and the potential for AMR.

“We are investing in a range of innovative antibiotics, vaccines, alternative technologies, and diagnostics for resistant infections. We are advancing our pipelines, but more work and investment into multiple approaches is needed to overcome the significant scientific difficulties of antibiotic discovery”.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Understanding evolving bacterial resistance patterns is a key element in managing the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These data can be used to inform antimicrobial resistance mitigation strategies and provide physicians and healthcare practitioners with information to assist in the selection of appropriate treatments for their patients.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges

Pfizer’s Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) program (formerly TEST) has monitored changing bacterial resistance patterns for over 13 years across more than 60 countries.   It provides physicians and the healthcare community with cumulative data on bacterial surveillance.  Data from this effort have been reported in manuscripts and congress abstracts.    These cumulative data are also accessible through a publicly available web site (www.atlas-surveillance.com) that offers an interactive platform to enable physicians to evaluate data, conduct analyses, and export tables and figures corresponding to specific countries and regions, and customized by pathogen(s) and antibiotic(s). The ATLAS database is updated every 6 months with emerging data from over 200 institutions around the world.  ATLAS access is also available through a mobile App to enable data access at the point of care.


The LEADER Program, established in 2004, is a national (US) initiative to monitor the activity of linezolid and comparator agents against target Gram-positive pathogens.


The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, which began in 1997 and is managed by JMI Laboratories, was designed to monitor the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections globally.  Each year, the program surveys over 30,000 Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms from medical centers participating in the global study.


The TEST program was established in 2004 and is a global program that tracks antibiotic resistance for both Zyvox and Tygacil antibiotics as well as other antibiotics. The scope of the TEST program (2004-2016) has reached 2,700 sites in 69 countries (cumulative total) since inception. Currently, the program holds 200 active sites in 52 countries. Since 2004, the TEST program has provided valuable data and information – generating over 360 posters and 57 peer reviewed manuscripts to date. Results are available on a web-based interactive platform that includes a dynamic database of “real-time” surveillance data


The Global Antifungal Surveillance Program determines the frequency of occurrence of resistance among fungal pathogens causing infections in hospitalized patients. This global program includes 62 participating medical centers in the SENTRY Program, located in North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.


China-based antibiotic resistance surveillance programs:  Since 2005, CHINET has investigated the anti-bacterial resistance and susceptibility rate of clinical isolates from major regions in China. It has accumulated around 600,000 isolates so far and will also expand its coverage to all regions in 2017.CHIFNET investigates the anti-fungal resistance and susceptibility rate from all the regions since 2009, with about 3,500 isolated collected per.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and greatest cause of cancer death among women in South Africa (SA). Poor education and lack of awareness of breast health issues, cultural barriers and no access to healthcare facilities have hindered efforts by the government to combat the disease among low-income communities.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
AstraZeneca South Africa’s Phakamisa program is taking significant steps in helping improve breast health awareness and breast cancer survival rates. Derived from the Zulu word meaning to “uplift” or “elevate”, Phakamisa is boosting capacity in diagnosis and treatment, providing medicines and raising disease awareness in communities across South Africa.
As leaders in breast cancer treatment, AstraZeneca established the program to break down barriers preventing detection, diagnosis and treatment. Central to this effort is addressing the major differences in the treatment of breast cancer across segments of the South African population. For example, rural black women are much less likely than white women to seek early help due to reasons such as poverty, lack of access to medical centers with appropriate services, cultural barriers such as the stigmatisation of breast cancer, suspicion of modern medicine and preferences to be treated by traditional healers
Consequently, a large number of women with breast cancer are presenting at health clinics with late-stage symptoms and with accordingly poor prognosis.
To overcome these barriers, Phakamisa conducted a needs assessment, focusing on stakeholder engagement and the patient journey. The findings paved the way for implementing a specialised six-point plan, tailored to the needs of low-income patients:
Improved education and awareness in patients
Overcoming cultural barriers that prevent patients seeking early help
Improved access to oncology services and medicines  
National breast cancer screening/education programs
Increasing capacity and improving efficiency of the referral process
Enhanced skills and training of staff to treat patients with breast cancer in the public sector
To date, Phakamisa has reached over 600,000 women by Navigators across the country. Over 40,000 public meetings have been held, some 5,000 women have raised concerns about their own breast health and over 2,500 malignant lumps correctly referred for early diagnosis and treatment. The primary objective of the Navigators remains to support diagnosed breast cancer patients in the public system through a complex and daunting journey. Courses have been provided to 250 healthcare professionals and 400 volunteers have been trained.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Childhood diarrhea is the biggest cause of child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second biggest killer of children worldwide. Annually it accounts for 2.2 million children’s lives, killing more under-five year olds than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.
Globally some 2.5 billion episodes of diarrhea occur in children under-five, with more than half of these seen in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Rapid urbanization means that cholera and acute watery diarrhea persist in high density, poverty stricken slums including in Nairobi, Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro.
The presence of WASH facilities in school gains 272 million school-attendance days each year due to improved health. Learning achievement is increased and older girls are afforded privacy and dignity to ensure menstrual hygiene.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GlaxoSmithKline's Personal Hygiene & Sanitation Education (PHASE) project is helping to reduce diarrhea-related disease by encouraging school children to wash their hands. GSK established PHASE in 1998 and has so far invested over USD 9.4 million in the program. PHASE is run in partnership with AMREF, Save the Children and Earth Institute at Columbia University, as well as national Ministries of Health and Education in countries where the program is active. The program has had impressive results so far. For example, a study by AMREF in Kenya showed that after four years, 88% of children from participating schools washed their hands after using the toilet, compared with 46% from non-participating schools. PHASE was extended to Millennium Villages in Malawi and Senegal during 2008 and now operates in a total of 16 countries. 
GSK has a PHASE steering committee with representatives from its partner organizations to help expand the program into more countries. 
PHASE provides resource-poor teachers with child-based, relevant education materials and it is also synonymous with concurrent development of water, sanitation and hand washing facilities in schools and the ‘tippy-tap’, a highly effective, low-cost technology to provide water for hand washing particularly when the resource is in short supply. The program provides in-school education about hygiene and sanitation practices using child-friendly and context specific materials and techniques and ‘child-to-child’ or ‘child-to-family’ education promoting on hygiene and sanitation practices essential to health and well-being. 
Lessons learned
Different country programs provide their own challenges and lessons including the following:
PHASE, whether stand alone or integrated is not a replacement for government services. High functioning political and social acumen is required to ensure programs are perceived as complementary to existing government approaches. Without this ownership is limited and longer term sustainability becomes questionable.
The importance of consulting teachers and children during material design and preparation, and the value of pre-testing before roll-out to large numbers of schools. 
A ‘standard’ national set of PHASE materials could be found inappropriate for all children. This underlines the need to consider regional differences within a country.
Children have a different world-view to adults. The voice of children in project meetings, design and evaluation is central to the effective adaptation and implementation of PHASE.
The need to create lasting relationships with key implementing partners alongside peer mentoring, study tours and networking between projects. The challenge is how to sustain these linkages and capture experiences and learning. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To date over 1.8 million children have been reached by the PHASE program, which extends to sixteen countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, South East Asia and Europe. These include four of fifteen countries that globally account for three quarters of all annual child deaths due to diarrhoea – India (386,600), Bangladesh (151,700), Uganda (29,300) and Kenya (27,400); and four of thirteen that account for 83 per cent of the estimated 1.2 billion people who practice open defecation; namely Bangladesh, Brazil, India and Indonesia.
Impact of PHASE has been well documented: for example, in Nicaragua a five-fold increase in hand washing after latrine use was observed among pupils and the proportion of children reporting diarrhea in a two-week period fell from over 40% to just 13%. Similarly, diarrhea episodes reported in Kenyan schools dropped from 11% to 8% and respiratory infections from 43% to 14%. In Indonesia, at a baseline 29.1% of children had reported diarrhea during the past month, compared to only 0.7% at end-line.
In addition, a positive correlation is also reported between the presence of PHASE in school attendance, participation and academic achievement. In Bangladesh school attendance rose from 66% to 75% and school completion from 55% to 68% following the implementation of PHASE.

Cervical cancer is the most common women’s cancer in sub-Saharan Africa and is the third-most common cancer in women, with 485,000 new cases and 236,000 deaths in 2013 alone. More than 85% of the global burden of cervical cancer occurs in developing countries, and 80-90% of women in sub-Saharan Africa have never had a pelvic exam. Cervical cancer is five times more common among women who are HIV-positive. By 2030, cervical cancer is expected to claim nearly half a million lives per year, with over 95% of deaths concentrated in low- and middle-income countries.

Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon offers the HPV vaccination to pre-adolescent girls, which prevents most cases of cervical cancer. PRRR supports country-led vaccination campaigns with vaccine donations, programmes, and resources for community education and outreach.
PRRR supports its partners to screen women for breast cancer via clinical breast examinations, and provides screening for cervical cancer for women aged 30-49 years, particularly those living with HIV.
Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon’s partners implement the simple, inexpensive cervical pre-cancer “See-and-Treat” screening approach. It involves visual inspection of the cervix with vinegar (acetic acid) to detect pre-cancerous lesions, followed soon or immediately afterward, when necessary, by ablative or electrosurgical (LEEP) treatment, as dictated by the woman’s needs. PRRR is also helping test new molecular testing technologies that will help focus resources on women at highest risk of developing cancer.
In 2016, 316 652 women have been screened for cervical cancer, 119 192 girls have received all doses of the HPV vaccination and 22 039 women have been treated with cryotherapy or LEEP for cervical cancer.
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation has committed $1.2 million over three years, and will work with its Secure the Future Technical Assistance Program faculty in the region to expand the availability of vital cervical cancer screening and treatment and breast care education and detection, especially for women most at risk of getting these cancers in Secure the Future target countries because they are HIV-positive. In Tanzania, with the Foundation’s support, five community-based organizations will screen more than 50,000 women between ages 30 and 50 years and those living with HIV for cervical and breast cancer as well as refer 600 for treatment at regional hospitals.
In September 2011, MSD* announced that it would contribute USD 3 million over three years to the Pink Ribbon-Red Ribbon initiative to help address both cervical and breast cancer in sub-Saharan African nations by supporting disease education, screening and treatment efforts as well as increased access to cervical cancer vaccination. Through this three-year partnership, MSD will work with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to support the first phase of the program to raise awareness in Zambia and Tanzania about the burden of breast and cervical cancer, mobilize additional program partners and donors, advocate for increased access to screening, treatment and cervical cancer vaccination as well as to promote follow-up care among women in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, MSD has provided in-kind donations and technical support to the national cervical cancer vaccination programs in both Zambia and Botswana.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
HIV and AIDS are social issues as well as medical challenges. Knowing that HIV is transmitted by sexual intercourse, sharing needles and from mother to baby is not enough in itself to guarantee the changes in behavior that can protect people from infection. Nor does the growing availability of ARV drugs around the world mean that everyone who needs treatment will come forward, that they can afford blood tests or good nutrition, or that they understand these drugs must be taken at the right time every day of their lives to avoid dangerous drug resistance.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The program targets its funds towards projects that fulfill one or more of these criteria:Delivering greater and meaningful involvement of people living with HIVThe Greater Involvement of People living with HIV (GIPA) principle – the adoption of strategies and practices that deliver the greater and meaningful involvement of people living with HIV in AIDS policy, programing and service delivery has adopted it as one of its criteria for selecting projects and partners.
Building capacity in the community Communities affected by HIV may face many challenges that require significant resources, time and skills to address. Positive Action has supported the formation of local, regional and global organizations of people living with and affected by HIV and their networks. We continue to support programs that help to build the capacity of communities and their organizations.Tackling stigma and discriminationPeople affected by HIV and AIDS have experienced stigma and discrimination since the first appearance of the epidemic. People's fear of disease and death was compounded by transmission of HIV being sexual and by existing attitudes to some of those most vulnerable to infection.
This stigma remains a real barrier to access to essential services, whether prevention, care or treatment. Self-stigma prevents people from coming forward, while active HIV discrimination is commonly found in communities, public services, health care and the legal system. Stigma is addressed by many Positive Action projects and is the specific target of our work with Vida Digna in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama.
Testing innovations in education, care and treatment Where antiretroviral treatment has become available, the success of that provision depends on many factors and some of these have to be addressed by and with the affected community: involving people living with HIV and AIDS (GIPA); tackling discrimination; reducing stigma; education about treatment, adherence, side effects (achieving ""treatment literacy""); promoting healthy living and positive health, dignity and prevention. We support programmes along the entire continuum of care, with specific attention to improving adherence and linkage to care in our Positive Action Southern Initiative.
Much progress has been made since the first cases of HIV and AIDS were recognized in the 1980s. However, more work is needed. Major barriers to accessing optimal treatment and care throughout the world still remain. These include a need to strengthen education, support services, local healthcare capacity and capabilities, and to reduce stigma and discrimination. In addition, as people are living longer and ageing with HIV, they are facing new medical, psychological and social challenges. We are focused on reaching out effectively to those affected by and those tackling the HIV pandemic to realize UNAIDS’ vision of zero new HIV infections, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero discrimination.
ViiV seeks out and builds new partnerships, connections and collaborations throughout the HIV community to help achieve these goals. Many of the obstacles facing people living with HIV are influenced by regional and cultural traditions. ViiV believes a collaborative approach is essential both to understanding the challenges associated with HIV and identifying the most appropriate solutions for various regions.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
HIV has had a global impact, but some populations have been more impacted than others. Unfortunately, access to prevention information, disease education and medical care are persistent unmet needs for communities affected by HIV throughout the world.
HIV infection rates continue to mount, especially in vulnerable and marginalized key affected populations. For the past 23 years, Positive Action has been working with these populations to overcome stigma and discrimination and to address these unmet needs. We will continue to support community-based organizations around the globe as long as these basic barriers to access and care exist.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
AIDS has become a leading cause of illness and death among women of reproductive age in countries with a high burden of HIV infection. Infants born to women living with HIV can become infected during pregnancy, labour and delivery or later through breastfeeding. More than 1400 children under 15 years of age become infected with HIV every day, most through mother-to-child transmission. Children account for more than 10% of all new HIV infections. Although mother-to-child transmission has been virtually eradicated in the developed world, the roll out of comprehensive programs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) still falls short of its target of universal access.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Positive Action for Children Fund currently provides grants to support diverse programs globally and offers a Technical Assistance program through our partners to support smaller community organizations. Through the fund, these organizations can continue to support affected communities and mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS on children and their families. The hope is to ensure that those communities deliver sustainable projects that reach individuals at risk from or coping with HIV infection. The Positive Action for Children Fund aims to support and inform the global effort to alleviate the impact of HIV and AIDS on maternal and child health by supporting interventions that engage affected communities, and to ensure those communities can themselves deliver projects that reach individuals at risk from or coping with HIV infection
The Positive Action for Children Fund announced its first grants in June 2010. It aims to support and inform the global effort to alleviate the impact of HIV and AIDS on maternal and child health by supporting interventions that engage or are led by affected communities.
The program targets funding towards projects that deliver in one or more of these areas:
Pursuing community engagement, participation and leadership
Using patient focused and family-centered approaches
Achieving integration between HIV services, and between HIV and sexual and reproductive health (S&RH) services
Generating demand for S&RH and PMTCT services
Using an evidence-base and delivering evidence-generation
Supporting or delivering advocacy
Strengthening grass roots action and organizations
The Fund is for community programming, so encourages applications for interventions devised with, and involving, affected communities themselves.
PACF projects range across all four elements of the World Health Organization’s PMTCT strategy, as set out below:
Primary prevention  Sexually active people, in particular the young generation, need access to sex education, sexual health services and primary HIV prevention: projects that successfully deliver these can contribute to reducing the numbers of HIV+ parents in successive generations.Reproductive choice for PLWHIV People living with HIV should be able to enjoy sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing; as well as make informed choices about the timing and number of children: projects need to take a rights-based approach that can enhance mainstream services as well as targeting interventions that deliver the equitable treatment of people living with HIV.PMTCT interventions Mothers living with HIV need to be helped to prevent their babies becoming infected, by the use of ARV treatment and appropriate breastfeeding regimes: projects need to explore the implications of the latest guidance and research for implementation in this area.Children and families  Infants, children and adolescents in families affected by HIV, both infected and uninfected, have a variety of needs: projects can impact on early testing and treatment, how young people cope with their status and treatment requirements, the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and the health and welfare of children and young people whose families and opportunities have been affected by HIV.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The Positive Action for Children Fund awarded £3.4 million to 17 projects in 12 countries in 2013. Sixteen of the recipients are new grantees, and one is a current grantee who will receive renewed funding. This is in addition to the £3.9 million to 99 organisations in 26 countries which were awarded in 2012 – which included 84 renewed grants plus an additional 15 new grants.
In 2014 PACF launched a video contest called “Every Footstep Counts” in order to raise awareness about the fight to end mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The contest encouraged organisations around the world working on PMTCT to submit videos telling their story. In addition to receiveing an unrestricted grant of $10,000 winners were also given the opportunity to attend the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia (20-25 July 2014) to present their video in the Global Village.  
Aligned to the Global Plan for the elimination of transmission of HIV from mother to child, the PACF is currently funding  more than 100 programs globally – with about 90% of its support targeted at sub-Saharan Africa. The impact at a community level is in the thousands of community health workers trained, the hundreds of community leaders that are providing local leadership and the tens of thousands of people, primarily women of reproductive age who are more likely to be using antenatal and PMTCT services as a result of PACF funded grantees working at a local community level.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is one of the top 3 killers of children worldwide. Every 60 seconds, a child dies from this preventable and curable disease—90% of these children live in Africa.
Malaria keeps more children out of school than any other disease and keeps adults out of work, leading to billions of dollars drained out of the African economy.
There has been global progress in the fight against malaria but a USD 3.6 billion funding gap for malaria control must be closed to ensure progress toward the elimination of this disease and prevent the gains made from being reversed.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Teaming up with several partners including Novartis and Alere, Malaria No More’s “Power of One” is a global digital fundraising campaign enabling the broad public to donate malaria treatments for children in Africa. Every dollar donated buys and delivers a full treatment course for a child with malaria.
Novartis is the campaign’s exclusive treatment sponsor. The company is supporting the campaign financially and in 2014, for the second year in a row, will match up to 1 million treatments funded by the public.
The campaign provides rapid diagnostic tests to help diagnose malaria in remote settings and provides artemisinin-based combination therapies (ATCs) for children with confirmed cases of malaria.
Zambia is the initial focus of the Power of One campaign. Working with John Snow International, the Zambian Ministry of Health, the Peace Corps and PATH MACEPA, the campaign is stepping up national efforts to help the country achieve universal coverage of testing and treatment and drive down malaria morbidity and mortality. To date, two million treatments have been delivered to Zambia within the scope of the campaign. One million treatments were funded through public donations and Novartis matched these with a further one million treatments. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2014, for the second year in a row, Novartis is matching public donations with up to 1 million free donated antimalarial treatments, and is supporting the campaign financially. Through differential pricing, Malaria No More can source quality-assured antimalarial pediatric treatments from the suppliers it chooses. If sourced from Novartis, the company provides Coartem Dispersible without profit for purchase through the campaign.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In India, comparing health statistics of rural and urban areas shows great inequalities. Doctors in the interiors have limited or no access to the latest developments and updates. Their challenge is to remain updated through limited resources. One of vital areas for a primary care practitioner in rural India is emergency medicine (chest pain, snake bites, scorpion sting, seizures, and domestic injuries). These cases warrant early diagnosis, preliminary treatment and referral to higher centres.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
In 2009, Sanofi launched a two-pronged strategy to improve the quality of healthcare practices in rural India, aimed at empowering rural medical practitioners through a structured continuing education program across India.
Through Prayas (2009 – 2012), specialists from semi-urban areas shared latest medical knowledge, clinical experience and practical insights through structured workshops for general practitioners from smaller towns and villages in the interiors of India through a ‘mentor-mentee’ model.
The partnership with American College of Physicians and American College of Gastroenterology ensured quality of program content and provided certification of respiratory and gastroenterology modules respectively. At the time of initiation, Prayas knowledge modules were validated and certified by American College of Physicians and American Gastroenterology Association.
As Prayas developed further, the ‘Prayas Expert Groups’ were constituted which comprised India’s top 48 clinicians who validated the knowledge modules.
Four regional Prayas Expert Groups comprising top clinicians certified the content of emergency medicine modules and also helped in seeking regional/local collaborations.
Experts’ specialties included chest medicine, cardiology, pediatrics, gastroenterology, diabetes, critical care, internal & community medicine.
The trainers (mentors) travelled to rural clusters every 8-10 weeks and conducted training programs for primary care practitioners.
To complement this program, the Hoechst Business Unit, a Sanofi Unit, also launched a new range of quality medicines at affordable prices in these geographical areas. The product range helped address the challenges of accessibility, affordability and availability of quality medicines to patients in remote villages.
Lessons learned                           
The presentation & management of emergency cases in rural India varies considerably versus the western world, and this necessitates geographical customization of the modules, made by Prayas Regional Expert Groups. It was thus crucial to get as trainers, physicians that have hands-on experience in order to address practical issues and ensure customization of the program.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
A total of 6,200 such programs have been done since the inception of Prayas. As of 2011, 11,500 primary care practitioners and 564 trainers participated in the program.
In 2012, 940 workshops were conducted covering 7,548 doctors. The digital platform promotion was rolled out in December 2012 and between Dec ’12 – Jan ’13 the site had registered 1,400 hits based on google analytics report.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It usually affects the lungs causing coughing, fever and weight loss. Although the disease has long been both preventable and curable, one person dies from TB somewhere in the world every twenty seconds. Treatment requires six months or more of combinations of antibiotics to ensure complete cure and more effective drugs are urgently needed to shorten treatment. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
PreDiCT-TB is a public-private partnership funded by the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, comprising three major pharmaceutical partners (GSK, Sanofi, and Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson), two biotechnology firms (ZF Screens and Microsens Medtech) and fifteen academic partners headed by the University of Liverpool. The multidisciplinary consortium brings together experts in microbiology, pharmacology, engineering, mathematical modelling, and clinical trials to create a new integrated framework for TB drug development, making optimal use of preclinical information to design the most efficient clinical trials.
PreDiCT-TB aims to overcome disconnects in TB drug development by adopting a fully integrated multidisciplinary approach grounded in pharmacokinetic (PK) – pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis and calibrated by clinical outcomes. By effectively integrating preclinical information into the early clinical phase, the Consortium aims to provide a new framework and tools that will facilitate the transition of the best combinations of drugs to late phase development and maximise their chances of success.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
In 2013, Janssen performed a monotherapy PK/PD analysis in a mouse model of tuberculosis infection and a combination PD study combining several first and second line tuberculosis drugs. PreDiCT-TB partners are studying the same drugs and their combinations in other preclinical models.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Influenza pandemics are rare but recurring events. They have typically occurred every 10-50 years throughout recorded history. The potentially serious impacts on human health, national economies and social infrastructure are of global concern. The last of three pandemics in the 20th century originated in Hong Kong in 1968-1969, causing around one million deaths. In June 2009 the WHO declared the 21st century’s first pandemic, which officially ended in August 2010.
With the ease and speed of travel, a localised epidemic can transform into a pandemic rapidly. Hence, advance planning and preparedness are critical to help mitigate the impact. This includes stockpiling of essential antiviral medicines and vaccines.
Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is on the front line of national pandemic defense strategies. The World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (ECDC) and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have stated that Tamiflu is one of two approved antivirals with activity against the pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza virus.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Roche works closely with the WHO to maintain Tamiflu stockpiles for distribution by the WHO to countries in need during a pandemic. The stockpiles can also be used for preventative measures to quickly contain and manage local outbreaks. Roche also works with governments, private companies and other organisations to strengthen their global pandemic preparedness.
Since 2005 Roche has provided Tamiflu capsules and active pharmaceutical ingredient to governments for use in the event of a pandemic at substantially reduced prices. Low income countries can purchase Tamiflu at further reduced prices (see pricing information on website). Roche has also developed a pandemic preparedness plan, in association with the WHO and governments, that forms the basis of many company plans.
Since some low-income countries are unable to create an adequate stockpile of Tamiflu, even with reduced prices, in 2009 the company launched the Tamiflu Reserves Program for member countries of the GAVI Alliance, excluding India. Through the program Roche offers Tamiflu at further reduced prices and a spread payment over a number of years.
In 2005, Roche granted sublicenses to three generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals and HEC Group in China and Hetero Pharmaceuticals in India, to produce generic Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for pandemic use in China, India and developing countries in case of a pandemic. In 2006, Roche also provided information to a South African generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, Aspen Pharmaceuticals, to allow it to produce oseltamivir for pandemic use in Africa.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To help the global response to pandemic influenza, Roche has:
Fulfilled pandemic orders for Tamiflu from more than 95 countries through differentiated pandemic pricing;
Extended the shelf-life of Tamiflu from five to seven years;
Granted sublicenses to the patent for oseltamivir to companies in India, China and South Africa to produce generic oseltamivir for pandemic use in these regions.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating illness that affected up to 60% of the population in some areas of Haiti. Primary treatment and prevention strategies to combat this disease involved annual mass drug administration (MDA). Co-fortified salt helps reduce LF transmission but approximately 58% of children suffered from iodine deficiency in Haiti and no national salt iodization program existed.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
With University of Notre Dame, the partnership supported both the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Haiti and the elimination of iodine deficiency by:
Decreasing levels of iodine deficiency among children by scaling up and launching fortified salt initiative (diethylcarbamezine and iodine) to help reduce LF transmission.
Increasing the number of health workers involved in MDA (mass drug administration) and increasing the number of LF patients treated.
Enhancing the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of program efficacy to help shape the future strategy for LF elimination in Haiti.   
Summary of impact:
From 2011 to 2014, the AbbVie Foundation provided $2.6 million USD to University of Notre Dame (UND) to address lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Haiti. The grant supported efforts to reduce iodine deficiency among the 58% of Haitian children who are affected through salt/DEC co-fortification programs (which reduces LF transmission). Over the course of this multi-year grant, UND provided treatment to approximately two million people and 8,000 health workers delivered the MDA, the first MDA ever conducted in a capital city. 
In addition, 78% of households in certain regions reported using co-fortified salt, which helps reduce LF transmission, whereas rates at the start of the grant were as low as 25%. More than 900,000 pounds of co-fortified salt were sold to households, businesses, and NGOs. The AbbVie Foundation’s grant also supported research on vector mosquitos to determine the effects of co-fortified salt on LF transmission.

Limited or lack of access to needed specialty care services, particularly for complex, chronic conditions, in rural and underserved communities. 
Need to strengthen the skills and capabilities of primary care providers in rural or remote settings so that they can manage and treat their complex patients in their own communities – enabling the right care at the right place and at the right time.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
The ECHO Institute, in collaboration with local implementing partners, will replicate Project ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) in selected communities in India and Vietnam.  Project ECHO® is a “telementoring” model that links expert multidisciplinary specialist teams with multiple primary care providers through “virtual clinics” (teleECHOTM clinics) where experts mentor and share their expertise via case-based learning, thereby enabling primary care clinicians to develop the ability to treat patients with complex conditions in their own communities.  A community health worker program will also be developed to further expand access to appropriate care in rural communities.
This initiative aims to: 
Improve the quality and performance of health workforce
Strengthen the capacity of the health care system
Demonstrate the utility of the ECHO model as an efficient approach to improve access to quality health care

            Partnership objectives
Project ECHO’s overarching goal is to increase access to best practice cancer care for the vulnerable populations in the United States and around the world. To accomplish this, two supporting goals are to expand the ECHO footprint in cancer both domestically and internationally to overcome some of the health disparities in cancer care and for the ECHO model to become part of the fabric of cancer prevention, screening, treatment, palliation and survivorship in the United States and Africa. The purpose of this five-year project funded by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation is to develop and test this new paradigm for providing cancer prevention, screening, care, treatment, palliative care and survivorship to poor and vulnerable communities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
For many poor and vulnerable patients, quality prevention, screening, treatment, palliative care and survivorship services are either unavailable or access to them is very limited. A significant driver of these disparities is a gap in knowledge transfer and access, which inhibits patients from getting the right care at the right place and at the right time.
By 2030, the global burden of cancer is expected to grow to 21.7 million new cancer cases and 13 million new cancer deaths due to the growth and aging of the population. The future burden is likely to be even larger than these estimates given the adoption of western lifestyles including smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity and fewer childbirths in economically developing countries.5 Given the burden of disease from cancer, much work still needs to be done to reduce overall cancer deaths and increase the knowledge of cancer prevention, screening, control, treatment, care and survivorship best practices across all segments of the healthcare workforce and the general population.
Globally, cancers figure among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in 2012.6 The number of new cases is expected to rise by approximately 70% over the next 2 decades, increasing from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million by 2032. More than 60% of the world’s total new annual cases occur in Africa, Asia and Central and South America, accounting for more than 70% of the world’s cancer deaths. The most common causes of cancer deaths worldwide are cancers of the lung (1.59 million deaths), liver (745,000 deaths), stomach (723,000 deaths), colorectal (694,000), breast (521,000 deaths), and esophagus (400,000 deaths). 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Project ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) improves capacity and access to specialty care for rural and underserved populations. This low-cost, high-impact intervention is accomplished by linking expert multidisciplinary specialist teams with multiple primary care clinicians through teleECHOTM clinics, where experts mentor and share their expertise via case-based learning, enabling primary care clinicians to develop the ability to care for patients with complex conditions in their own communities. Initially implemented to increase access to HCV care in 2003, the model has since been expanded to 56 other conditions with more than 103 replicating partners in 19 countries.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The anticipated evidence of impact of this project includes: higher provider self-efficacy, increased adherence to current national best practices for cancer screening, prevention and treatment; increased capacity for care of patients with cancer; development of tools that support the use of the ECHO model to train CHWs and others in cancer screening, prevention and survivorship; increased replication of the ECHO model for cancer; and positive movement towards long-term sustainability for cancer-focused ECHOs.
Measurement of progress towards objectives
Estimated overall value of partnership: $10+ million (U.S.)
A minimum of 25 cancer hubs in the US are fully operational (e.g. holding regular clinics, engaging spoke participants, including a multidisciplinary hub team, utilizing the case-based learning model, and tracking outcomes). 
Pending the assessment and outreach process, at least one country or region serving hub in African country is fully operational to address cancer.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Although today’s treatments for HIV mean that millions of lives have been saved, people still have to take a lifetime of treatments, which takes an emotional toll and places an economic burden on society that is particularly challenging in countries with limited resources. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
GSK and UNC-Chapel Hill will create a dedicated HIV Cure center and a jointly owned new company that will focus on discovering a cure for HIV/AIDS. The partnership will dedicate the next 30 years to finding a cure so that one day the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be ended.
The partnership aims to redefine the traditional way of conducting research and create a new model to seek the breakthroughs needed to tackle an extraordinarily challenging global health issue. It will focus on the latest scientific approaches to curing HIV, including a leading research approach toward an HIV cure sometimes called “shock and kill.” This approach seeks to reveal the hidden virus that persists in people with HIV infection despite successful drug therapy, and augment the patient’s immune system to clear these last traces of the virus and infected cells. Part of this new paradigm was first tested at UNC-Chapel Hill and in 2012 a team led by UNC-Chapel Hill researchers demonstrated that latent HIV might be unmasked by new therapies. Recently, researchers at the university received US Food and Drug Administration approval for a study in HIV-positive volunteers to combine this technique and an immune-boosting strategy.
Through the new company, GSK will invest $4 million per year for five years to fund the initial HIV Cure center research plan, and a small research team from GSK will move to Chapel Hill to be co-located with UNC researchers. The university will provide world-class laboratory space on its medical campus for the HIV Cure center and the new company. GSK will be contributing its expertise and know-how in medicines discovery, development and manufacturing, and UNC-Chapel Hill will bring to the table its research and translational medicine capabilities, talent, as well as access to patients and funding. The new joint company, Qura Therapeutics, will handle the business side of the partnership, including intellectual property, commercialization, manufacturing and governance.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
On the island nation of Mauritius, the population presents a very high genetic predisposition to cardiac disease. Myocardial infarction (MI) is common across all ages in Mauritius, with some patients in their twenties. Many forty year olds have had a second infarct. Stroke is also common in Mauritius, with young people suffering stroke on the increase. Stroke can have very subtle and indistinguishable symptoms, leading to very late patient presentation at the hospital – sometimes days or even weeks after the event, making it very difficult to reduce long-term damage. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The accident and emergency (A&E) of Mauritius have already implemented an efficient system of picking up stroke patients and taking them to the correct centre to undergo treatment; and physicians are well trained and hospitals equipped adequately to handle a stroke patient. For this reason, this project mainly focuses on strokes awareness raising, which implies knowing whom to contact in the event and what measures to take in prevention, such as behavioural changes.
In addition to this, after a stroke, most patients are left to fend for themselves, though many suffer from physical and mental injury and thus battle to adjust. Hence, the project aims to equip a ward in order to offer physical therapy, speech therapy, counselling and adaptation not just for the patient, but also for caregivers and family members.
Finally, the project has the objective to raise the number of up-skilled caregivers, nurses, healthcare professionals and wards equipped to deal with their patients, particularly by involving NGOs in Mauritius, which can actively engage with patients.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Each year, approximately 430,000 babies around the world become infected with HIV during their mothers' pregnancy, during birth or through breastfeeding. Enabling pregnant women to know their HIV status before they give birth is the first step in preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. However, for many pregnant women living in the developing world, testing is limited because of cost, time required to receive results, and lack of trained health care staff and testing facilities.
 Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Rapid on-site testing can have a significant impact in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Using a small amount of whole blood, serum or plasma, any program in a remote setting can obtain results regardless of access to laboratory equipment or electricity. To facilitate access to rapid HIV testing, in 2002 Abbott made a commitment to donate rapid (15 minute) HIV tests to PMTCT programs in all of Africa and the Least Developed Countries, as defined by the United Nations. In 2013, the HIV Rapid Test Donation Program became part of the AbbVie Foundation.
The program has also extended its PMTCT donations to include testing of spouses and children of pregnant women who are found to be HIV positive through the program.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To date, more than 27 million rapid HIV tests have been donated. This program has historically been in 33 countries and it now operating in 45. It is estimated that a minimum of 150,000 cases of HIV have been averted in infants over the past twelve years by conducting this program.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Each year 162,000 mothers die in Africa due to the lack of basic medical care and the shortage of skilled health staff. In most African countries, the number of trained professionals is inadequate and poorly distributed. Health campaigns clearly suffer from the way health personnel are distributed geographically.
In Senegal, there are two midwives for every 1,000 live births. The maternal mortality and infant-child mortality rate is 401 per thousand live births and almost one in every two women receives no assistance from a skilled carer.
In Côte d'Ivoire, the medical facilities have seriously deteriorated after years of political instability. Although there has been a slight drop in the infant mortality rate since 1990, it still remains high. The gradual introduction of free maternal health care is increasingly costly for a still-fragile health care system.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To address this imbalance, AMREF intends to train 4,900 midwives, including nursing midwives, in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire. This project looks to upgrade the skills of midwives in rural areas in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality and more specifically to:
Roll out e-learning training courses for midwives, build a regional e-learning platform, increase the number of centers using distance learning, transfer skills to local players involved in the program, increase the number of women and children who have access to healthcare, increase the number of women receiving care during childbirth and reduce the isolation of midwives and increase coverage in rural areas.
This partnership falls under AMREF’s “Stand up for African Mothers” campaign, a campaign to train 15,000 midwives by 2015 in 15 African countries.

HIV/AIDS has left millions of children in sub-Saharan Africa without parents. The Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development cofounded and continues to support the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative (REPSSI) for children affected by HIV/AIDS, poverty and conflict.
Psychosocial support is the right of every child.
Children and youth exposed to the devastating effects of poverty, conflict, HIV and AIDS are especially entitled to care for their emotional and social (psychosocial) wellbeing. Many have lost parents and family, experienced deprivation and abuse, been stigmatized, witnessed atrocities, and suffered overwhelming grief.
This generation of children will soon be leading our countries and our communities. They need the right support if they are to grow into capable and compassionate adults, and active citizens engaged in their communities.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In collaboration with NGOs, REPSSI develops and disseminates courses and tools for psychosocial support. Through its partners, REPSSI also assists thousands of children and households with income-generating measures to help them out of extreme poverty. REPSSI helps to improve access to HIV counselling and testing as well as adherence to antiretroviral therapy in Tanzania and Zambia, thus reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
2 million children per year receive psychosocial support and 451 teachers have been trained using the REPSSI Teachers Diploma.
REPSSI has experienced tremendous growth and is today recognized as the leading organization worldwide in the field of psychosocial support. REPSSI develops, accredits, and shares innovative, evidence-based and culturally appropriate methods and tools to provide psychosocial support and care for families, children and youth. REPSSI trains government officials, non-profit organizations, and community-based workers. The range of materials includes the Journey of Life and the Hero Book, both innovative tools developed for psychosocial work with children. REPSSI has also successfully developed an offline, distance-learning Certificate Course, which allows community-based workers, particularly those in rural areas, to study for an accredited qualification in support for vulnerable children.

The age structure of the population is changing rapidly in the People's Republic of China. It was estimated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC (2014) that 212 million people were aged 60 years and over in 2014, a number equivalent to the combined population of Germany, France and the U.K. Despite the huge number of older people and dementia patients, very little is known about dementia and appropriate care. In China, only 21% of the dementia patients get a standard diagnosis among those diagnosed, and only 19.6% of patients are taking appropriate treatments.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Eisai employees visited patients and their families across four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu) in China. Through such in-depth face to face visits, we learnt that healthcare providers and people close to patients including family play key roles in reducing misunderstanding of dementia, and encourage early diagnosis and treatment.
From these experiences, Eisai launched a public awareness campaign called “Remember I Love You”, aiming to correct stereotypical views such as “becoming forgetful is a natural phenomenon of aging, no intervention can stop it”, “it is a shame to suffer from dementia disease”, “dementia is not a fatal disease, so there is no need to take any action” and so on. Experts from Alzheimer’s Disease Chinese and dementia healthcare providers were invited to deliver speeches on dementia and care. Broad coverage by major newspapers and social media generated tremendous attention from the whole society.
As part of the “Remember I Love You” campaign, Eisai co-established an SNS platform called “Yellow Wristband” with China Population Welfare Foundation. It is a comprehensive application to provide education on dementia, simple self-assessment, drug compliance, memory clinic list. Particularly, the SNS platform provides online application function for yellow wristband, a wristband integrated with dementia patient information, in order to help them find home and contacts when they are wandering. Also, aligned with “Yellow Wristband” SNS platform’s launch, community-based activities including disease awareness campaign and cognition assessments were conducted all over the country.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
228 media reported our activities; we received more than 130,000 Likes on social media and a respective journal issued special coverage on “Remember that I Love you” and dementia patient story. More than 20,000 people registered on “Yellow Wristband” platform, about 10,000 people participated in “Yellow Wristband” community activities.
Measurement of progress towards objectives: 
Estimated overall value of partnership:
This partnership could promote a better understanding on dementia from the whole society, and encourage early diagnosis, appropriate treatment and a dementia-friendly community, which helps the whole society to reduce the burden of dementia.
Estimated amount of people impacted:

            What are the health needs and challenges?
RHD is caused by streptococcal pharyngitis, commonly known as strep throat. Strep throat is easily treated with penicillin. But untreated, some patients will eventually form scars on valves of the heart. Over time, this can lead to heart failure and, ultimately, early death. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, recent studies show that a staggering 1-3% of school-age children have early signs of disease. “BeatRHD Zambia” is tackling RHD through a multi-faceted effort involving research, health system strengthening, public awareness, and health policy activities. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Novartis is working with Lusaka University Teaching Hospital and the Zambian Ministry of Health in partnership with the University of Cape Town and Massachusetts General Hospital to combat rheumatic heart disease (RHD).  
Research. New technology is revolutionizing the way doctors can identify children with RHD. Portable echocardiography machines create ultrasound images of the heart that can show tissue damage even before symptoms appear. Using this new technology, over 3,000 schoolchildren in Lusaka have been screened. Children diagnosed with RHD are offered monthly penicillin injections according to national guidelines. The results of the screening will, for the first time, indicate the prevalence of RHD in a Zambian population using echocardiography. 
Health system strengthening. The partnership supports efforts of the local doctors and nurses to strengthen health systems in Lusaka to help children with strep throat and RHD receive the treatment they need. Currently, more than 25 government clinics in Lusaka have been enrolled in this effort. All clinics completed an initial training workshop about RHD prevention and treatment and receive ongoing coaching by nurses from the university hospital. At the invitation of the health authorities in Zambia, the partnership plans to extend the rollout of the RHD training and treatment effort from the initial Lusaka scheme to multiple provinces across Zambia. 
Public awareness. Public awareness is essential to RHD prevention and treatment. The partnership has distributed key messages through television and radio programs, and educational brochures and posters. Many of these activities take place during a nationally sponsored “RHD Week” each year. 
Health policy. The partnership has contributed to health policy work to support RHD elimination throughout Africa. Partners helped to sponsor meetings of technical experts from more than 10 countries on three occasions under the auspices of the Pan African Society of Cardiology, which ultimately helped seed an RHD Policy Roadmap developed by the African Union and agreed upon by African Ministers of Health and Heads of States. 
The initiative in Zambia is coordinated by Dr. John Musuku, Chief of Paediatrics at University Teaching Hospital. The Zambia Ministry of Health approves all programs that take place in government clinics.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Despite recent political developments, Burma remains one of the poorest countries in the world. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Burma ranks only 149th on the Human Development Index. Health indicators are extremely low and budgets allocated to health attain only 0.2% of GDP. This situation strongly impacts women's health.
In the urban Dala Township, which has a population of 150,000, maternal mortality is at 177/100,000 and there are six doctors and 21 midwives.
In the rural  Kawkareik District of the Karen State, which has a population of 480,000, there is a maternal mortality rate of 721/100,000 and only one doctor for 19,551 inhabitants and one midwife for 7,230 women.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
For this project supported by the Sanofi Espoir Foundation, PU-AMI teams intend to help reduce maternal and neonatal mortality by boosting the skills of midwives via an integrated approach based on community reproductive health workers (auxiliary midwives).
The overall aim of the project is to improve the skills of midwives by means of continuing education and to create a network of auxiliary midwives who will be trained and mentored by experienced midwives to facilitate information sharing and referrals to emergency health centers.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The world’s Least Developed Countries (LDCs) suffer the highest levels of disease and have the weakest healthcare systems. Limited access to medicines and diagnostics is just one part of the problem; there is a critical lack of even the most basic healthcare capacity. Many face a critical shortage of healthcare professionals, hospitals and laboratories, as well as low levels of understanding of the causes, prevention and treatment of disease.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Roche Secondment Program provides a unique opportunity for Roche employees to share capacity and transfer specialist know-how in an effective and sustainable way, whilst also gaining valuable personal development and experience opportunities. With all projects being health related, the program aims to support lasting changes to health through the experience and skills of Roche’s employees.
Employees can spend from three to twelve months working in a developing country in collaboration with a partner organisation which already has expertise on the ground. The program focuses on Least Developed Countries or low income or lower middle income economies.
Through combining the skills and resources within Roche with those of other organisations, the aim is to deliver sustainable outputs that could not have been achieved alone.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It kills more than 600,000 people each year, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is the leading cause of death in children under five. Because malaria is a global emergency that affects mostly poor women and children, the disease perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty in the developing world. Malaria-related illnesses and mortality cost Africa’s economy alone USD 12 billion per year.
Today, malaria can be prevented, diagnosed and treated with a combination of available tools, but it takes global commitment. Estimates indicate that USD 4.2 billion is needed each year to fund the fight against malaria effectively.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership was launched in 1998 by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank. Its goal was to provide a coordinated global approach to fighting malaria.
The RBM Partnership is the global framework for implementing coordinated action against malaria. It mobilizes resources for action and forges consensus among partners. The Partnership is made up of more than 500 partners, including countries where malaria is endemic, their bilateral and multilateral development partners, the private sector, nongovernmental and community-based organizations, foundations, and research and academic institutions. The Global Malaria Action Plan defines two stages of malaria control: first, scaling-up for impact (SUFI) of preventive and therapeutic interventions, and then sustaining control over time.
RBM’s strength lies in its ability to form effective partnerships both globally and nationally. Partners work together to scale up malaria control efforts at country level, coordinating their activities to avoid duplication and fragmentation, and to ensure optimal use of resources. RBM’s strategy is to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by implementing activities in all countries where malaria is endemic and by strengthening health systems. 
GlaxoSmithKline remains an active member of the private sector delegation and is currently a Board Member representing the private sector. GSK is also active in various working groups including the Malaria Advocacy Working Group, the Procurement & Supply Chain Management Working Group and the GMAP ll Task Force. GSK was involved in the launch of the Progress and Impact Report on A Decade of Partnership and Results.
Novartis is an active member of the private sector delegation to the RBM board and held the board seat from May 2010-2012. Today, Novartis continues its strong involvement in three RBM partner committees: Country/Regional Support Partner Committee, Strategic Communications Partner Committee, and Advocacy and Resource Mobilization Partner Committee. In 2009, with RBM and other partners, Novartis launched SMS for Life to help prevent stock-outs of antimalarials in Tanzania.  SMS for Life has since been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in Kenya, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. Over the years, the scope of the program has also expanded to more disease areas and health parameters. 
The malaria program is a flagship initiative of the Sanofi Access to Medicines department. It reflects the organization’s long term commitment to use its core skills to build a sustainable and comprehensive model to fight malaria on all fronts, from prevention to treatment. Sanofi and the Drugs for Neglected initiative (DNDi) have developed an artemisinin combination therapy: ASAQ (Artesunate Amodiaquine) Winthrop®. Sanofi also helps its partners in the field through a comprehensive set of Information Education and Communication tools and initiatives on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, which are tailored to the needs of all stakeholders in the healthcare chain.
Lessons learned
The RBM Partnership has demonstrated how a strong, well-organized multi-stakeholder partnership can help deliver broad health benefits while relieving overburdened health systems.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
RBM has produced a series of Progress and Impact Reports that comprehensively document progress in the fight against malaria.
According to the report entitled ‘A Decade of Partnership and Results’, global malaria deaths have dropped by an estimated 38%, with 43 countries (11 of them in Africa) cutting malaria cases or deaths by 50% or more, reversing the trend of the previous decade and saving over a million lives.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is endemic in over 100 countries. Most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America; 90% of all malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa.
Malaria transmitted by female members of the Anopheles mosquito family, which feed on human blood. The initial symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscular pains and mild diarrhoea. Infection can rapidly progress, leading to more severe symptoms, including delirium and convulsions, followed by coma and death.
People living in areas permanently affected by malaria can develop a partial immunity to the illness. In such individuals, infection leads to illness and inability to work or attend school, but it is less likely to prove fatal. Young children do not yet have such partial immunity, while pregnant women lose immunity they had, leaving them vulnerable. This is why most malaria deaths are in children under five years and in pregnant women.
Malaria continues to exact a heavy burden on the health and economies of communities across Africa. Economic research shows that malaria slows economic growth in Africa by up to 1.3 per cent each year. Malaria related illnesses and mortality cost Africa’s economy alone US$12 billion per year.
Malaria can be prevented by controlling the breeding of malaria carrying mosquitoes and sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets. It can be treated effectively too, using effective drugs at the correct dose for the right length of time. However, vaccines offer an economical and effective means of preventing diseases. Closing the gap left by mosquito nets and treatments, particularly in the face of growing resistance to anti-malarials and insecticides, a vaccine against malaria could prove an essential tool in the fight against the disease. Even a modestly efficacious malaria vaccine has the potential to protect hundreds of thousands from disease and death each year.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
For the past 30 years, GSK scientists have been working with others around the world to try to develop a vaccine against malaria. The RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate is currently the most advanced in development globally. It was created in 1987 by scientists working at GSK’s laboratories with scientists from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and developed in partnership with PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) since 2001, with grant monies from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. If approved, the RTS,S vaccine would be the first human vaccine against a parasite.
RTS,S aims to trigger the body’s immune system to defend against the P. falciparum malaria parasite when it first enters the human host’s bloodstream and/or when the parasite infects liver cells. The vaccine is designed to prevent the parasite from infecting, maturing and multiplying in the liver, after which time the parasite would re-enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells, leading to disease symptoms.
RTS,S is intended exclusively for use against the Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite, which is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.
GSK has taken the lead in the overall development of RTS,S and has invested more than $350 million to date and expects to invest a further $260 million until development is completed. With more than $200 million in grant monies from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) contributes financial, scientific, managerial, and field expertise to the development of RTS,S. GSK has committed that the eventual price of RTS,S will cover the cost of manufacturing the vaccine together with a small return of around 5% that will be reinvested in research and development for second-generation malaria vaccines, or vaccines against other neglected tropical diseases.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Results from a large-scale Phase III trial presented in 2013 in Durban demonstrated that RTS,S helped to protect young children and infants from clinical malaria up to 18 months after vaccination. These results demonstrated that over 18 months of follow-up, RTS,S almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children (aged 5-17 months at first vaccination) and to reduce by around a quarter the malaria cases in infants (aged 6-12 weeks at first vaccination). Vaccine efficacy was also assessed separately at each of the trial sites, which represent a wide range of malaria transmission settings; efficacy was found to be statistically significant at all sites in young children and at four out of eleven sites in infants.
Based on these data, GSK submitted in June 2014 a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA submission is the first step in the regulatory process toward making the RTS,S vaccine candidate available as an addition to existing tools currently recommended for malaria prevention. An effective vaccine for use alongside other measures such as bednets and anti-malarial medicines would represent an advance in malaria control. If a positive scientific opinion from the EMA is granted, the WHO has indicated a policy recommendation may be possible by end of 2015.

The Saloum Islands, which have a population of 30,944 inhabitants spread across 16 islands, have the worst health indicators in Senegal and have also experienced severe cholera epidemics. The situation is made worse by conditions of poor hygiene and low health coverage due mainly to the remoteness of the islands.
Description of partnership activities and how they meet needs and challenges
The Saloum Islands Health Care partnership Project between GlaxoSmithKline and the Ministry of Health and Medical Prevention of Senegal was started in July 2007 for an initial three year period. GSK has committed GBP 500,000 over four years, 2007-11.The aim of the project is to support and strengthen the primary health care delivery system at district level, to increase access to quality healthcare in the rural communities of Dionewar, Djirnda and Bassoul. Interventions and activities address the specific healthcare needs and priorities as identified by the district health services, in consultation with the communities.These include improving sanitation and water supply on the islands, training healthcare workers, deployment of additional staff (e.g. midwives), training of volunteer sanitation and hygiene officers, setting up health committees, installation of solar panels to supply electricity for clinics, upgrading of health huts, procurement of equipment and medicines and purchase of emergency ambulance boats. Two years into the project, sanitation coverage increased from 32% to 80%.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
Over 300,000 children worldwide develop cancer each year. If the illness is detected early enough, many of these children can be successfully treated.  80% of children with cancer in the developed world survive. However, in developing countries, survival rates can be as low as 10%.  The situation is worsened with many children often dying without access to palliative care.  World Child Cancer believes inequality in cancer treatment should not exist and that every child, regardless of where they live, should receive the very best possible treatment and care.
In the countries where WCC works, accessing healthcare services is a huge challenge for the general population. The problems are multiple and complex but typically include: 
Late diagnosis
Limited access to specialist and multidisciplinary care and facilities
Lack of efficient healthcare support

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
In the countries where World Child Cancer works, there is a huge challenge for the general population accessing healthcare services, with problems typically including late diagnosis, limited access to specialist and multidisciplinary care and facilities, lack of efficient healthcare support, socio-economic barriers, cultural beliefs and treatment abandonment.  
World Child Cancer works to improve diagnosis, treatment and support for children with cancer and their families.  They achieve this through the partnerships between hospitals, doctors and nurses in the developing world and the developed world, and operate a unique twinning model that focuses on local capacity building, empowering and training local healthcare professionals to develop locally appropriate, scalable and sustainable solutions through:  
Seed funding projects for five years; 
Integrating sustainability plans; and 
Building capacity in local healthcare systems  
Sandoz provides a donation that helps to fund activities that build local healthcare system capacity, in particular, enabling them to establish healthcare partnerships to build capacity and implement locally agreed plans to develop this model and enhance access to treatment and care. Through these partnerships valuable expertise and knowledge is shared between hospitals in developed and developing countries in order to build the capacity and knowledge of local doctors and nurses.  
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
In Year 1 (2016-2017) Sandoz ran a pilot with World Child Cancer, providing a donation to support work in the Philippines where access to healthcare is a big challenge for much of the population.  With this donation Sandoz supported the development of specialist cancer treatment centers in the island region of Mindanao where 1,000 cases of childhood cancer are expected annually. The centers increased capacity in the region, supporting the training and professional development of local healthcare professionals so that they can offer the best care and treatment possible. World Child Cancer estimates that due to this support, the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer was 351.  In Mindanao, 130 children were diagnosed who might not otherwise have received a diagnosis. In Davao specifically, over 60% (78) of these children are alive today because of this vital work.   
In 2017-2018 Sandoz will expand the pilot to a program that supports projects in Ghana, Myanmar, Mexico, as well as continuing to support the Philippines.  Each program has slightly different needs, but we will continue to focus on capacity building activities based on the success of the Philippines project.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Along with HIV/AIDS and malaria, tuberculosis is one of the most widespread infectious diseases in the world. One-third of the world’s population is infected with M. tuberculosis, and approximately 8.6 million people develop active disease annually. Of these, 1.3 million die each year. Treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) is long and complex, involving frequent intake of multiple drugs for at least six months. When administered properly, the treatment is generally highly effective. However, for many patients it is difficult to comply with six months of treatment. Poor compliance not only puts the patient at risk of treatment failure, but also creates conditions that encourage the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The key challenge is to simplify the treatment and fight resistant strains in order to control drug-resistance TB.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has lead an international group of scientists in the development of new indications for rifapentine, a Sanofi drug registered in the US since 1998 for the treatment of pulmonary drug-susceptible tuberculosis in combination with other drugs. In 2011, the CDC showed that rifapentine had the ability of considerably simplifying the treatment of latent tuberculosis, with the potential of improving patient compliance. 
Since 2011, Sanofi has also partnered with other research-based TB drug manufacturers through the Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens (CPTR) in order to share information on TB compounds within their respective drug pipelines to quickly identify and work together to develop the most promising TB drug regimen. 
Lessons learned
The CDC work on rifapentine in the treatment of latent TB is an example of a successful partnership which may deliver considerable gain for patients. Sharing information about R&D can speed up the development of TB drug combinations.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
A 2011 CDC study on rifapentine shows that the treatment of latent TB is a major milestone in the treatment of this infection. Sanofi has other projects in development with CDC on rifapentine in the treatment of latent and active TB, and is actively involved in the CPTR partnership in the search for innovative TB treatments.
In May 2014, Sanofi submitted to the US FDA a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for rifapentin in the treatment of latent TB.

Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) affect the lives of hundreds of millions of persons in the developing world, and more particularly communities living in remote rural areas, in urban slums and or in conflict zones with poor living and hygiene conditions.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2011, Sanofi and DNDi launched a partnership for the research of new treatments for nine neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for which new, adapted, and efficient tools are urgently needed to treat patients in endemic countries: kinetoplastid diseases (leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and human African trypanosomiasis), helminth infections (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiasis), and dracunculiasis, fascioliasis, and schistosomiasis.
In the framework of this agreement, Sanofi brings molecules from its libraries into the partnership, while DNDi and Sanofi collaborate in research activities on innovative molecular scaffolds. The core of the agreement lies in the innovative management of intellectual property generated through the collaboration. The rights to results produced by this partnership will be co-owned by Sanofi and DNDi. The partners will facilitate publication of the results to ensure access to the wider community of researchers focusing on NTDs. The public sector will benefit from the drugs developed through this agreement under the best possible conditions to ease access for patients in all endemic countries, irrespective of their level of economic development.
Since April 2009, Sanofi and DNDi have been working together to develop Fexinidazole, a new and promising drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. Current therapeutic options are either poorly tolerated or difficult to administer, notably for advanced-stage HAT disease. The development of a new, orally-administered treatment that matches the efficacy of current treatments and improves tolerance will be a major progress.
Lessons learned
Collaborative agreements between partners with different sets of expertise and resources are key to advances in the search for new treatments against NTDs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the World Health Organization, 627,000 malaria deaths were reported in 2012, 90% of which in Africa. Malaria is the third leading cause of mortality among African children and has a heavy impact on the economy of families and the affected countries, hindering the ability of adults to work and children to go to school. In 2001, the WHO recommended the use of artesunate-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat uncomplicated malaria to fight growing resistance to existing treatments.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In April 2005, Sanofi and DNDi formed a public-private partnership with the goal of developing a non-patented fixed-dose combination of artesunate-amodiaquine to better meet the patients’ needs, specifically those of children. DNDi developed the formulation combining two active ingredients in a single tablet and carried out the initial pharmaceutical and clinical development. Sanofi developed the product, carried out additional clinical studies, prepared the dossier for regulatory authorities and applied for WHO prequalification. The new treatment is simpler (1 or 2 tablets once a day) than the existing ones and dissolves in water, which makes it suitable for children.
The medicine is sold at a preferential prices, including “no profit no loss” prices, to governments of endemic countries, NGOs, and major sponsors such as UNITAID and the Global Fund. It is now registered in 33 countries and at the end of 2013, more than 277 million treatments were distributed.
In addition, an innovative Risk Management Plan (RMP) was designed by the partners to provide high-quality information on the safety and efficacy on this drug. This RMP comprises 23 clinical studies in 19 countries, primarily set-up in Africa, each of which documenting different aspects of ASAQ Winthrop safety and efficacy. It is expected that over 20,000 patients will be included in this RMP, which is the first such program to be submitted to the WHO. It is expected that this initiative will help build capacity in pharmacovigilance in sub-Saharan Africa, using narrowly-tailored methods of data collection on the safety and efficacy of medicines when they are used in “real life” situations.
Lessons learned
The medicine is available in most of the African malaria endemic countries, affordable for the patients most in-need, including children.
Improved public health is a complex challenge and the combination of expertise from various partners is essential to build sustainable solutions for patients most in-need.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
More than 277 million treatments of ASAQ Winthrop have been distributed in Africa since the medication became available in 2007. To participate in the fight against development of resistance to treatment, Sanofi decided in 2012 to share all the data collected during its clinical trials with the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN).
Sanofi and DNDi, received the 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Alliance Excellence Award from the Association of Strategic Alliance Professionals (ASAP), in recognition of the “profound, measurable, and positive social impact” that this decade-long public-private partnership has had in the fight against malaria.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) collaborate in the research and development of new antimalarial medicines, and in building capacity in pharmacovigilance in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2011 both parties agreed to work together to identify, characterize and optimize new candidate compounds. This three-year research project agreement, called “Orthology Malaria,” aims to develop drug candidates from a set of Sanofi’s compounds that have been selected for their potential activity against malaria parasites. Each stage of the project will be evaluated by the Sanofi–MMV Joint Steering Committee and assessed according to MMV’s criteria for compound progression.
In the field of pharmacovigilance, Sanofi and MMV have entered in 2009 into a partnership to support a large field-monitoring study developed in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program of Côte d’Ivoire and DNDi. The aim of this study, which is expected to involve 15,000 patients, is to assess the effectiveness and safety of Sanofi and DNDi's antimalarial ASAQ Winthrop® in real life conditions. This study is a key component of ASAQ Winthrop® Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is the first RMP submitted to the WHO and almost entirely carried out in Africa. Beyond the provision of high quality efficacy and safety data, the work performed through this RMP in close collaboration with African scientists and health officials will help build expertise on pharmacovigilance, and to design methods adapted to the needs and resources of their countries.
Since 2008, Sanofi has shared information with MMV on its malaria drugs portfolio, for both uncomplicated and severe malaria. Working groups were set up to review each of these projects and define specific collaborative actions between the two organizations for their further development.

Control and elimination of the most ""neglected"" of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)—Sleeping Sickness, Chagas disease, Buruli Ulcer, Leishmaniasis. 
Eliminate Sleeping Sickness by 2020.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impair the lives of millions of people, mainly in poor and remote areas of developing countries, conflict zones or urban slums.
Sleeping sickness new case numbers have recently declined, below 3,000 cases in 2015, yet, the screening and disease management must continue until its elimination. Leishmaniasis, Buruli ulcer and Chagas diseases each represent different challenges but are progressively coming under control.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi and the WHO signed a first 5-year partnership to combat sleeping sickness in 2001. A third 5-year agreement was signed in 2011 with the goal to eliminate sleeping sickness and improve the management of leishmaniasis, Buruli ulcer and Chagas disease. Sanofi committed the same amount of financial backing (25 MUSD) and drug donations, bringing its total contribution to USD 75 million over 15 years (2001-2016).
These funds are dedicated to diseases management and control programs, including screening of population of endemic areas, medical staff training, disease awareness campaigns, logistics and infrastructure and surveillance of resistance to treatments.
Sanofi produces three of the five medicines effective against sleeping sickness (pentamidine, eflornithine, melarsoprol). Through this partnership, 27 million people have been screened and around 175,000 people were diagnosed and treated for the disease, which is fatal if left untreated. 
In the field of leishmaniosis, each year around 1.3 million cases of leishmaniosis are diagnosed and around 20,00 deaths occur because of the disease. In Brazil, Sanofi offers a drug (Glucantime) at a preferential price  with more than 6 million doses distributed in 2015. Glucantime® is sold at a fixed price of USD 1.47 per ampoule to developing countries.
Sanofi also contributes to developing epidemiological monitoring and research to find new treatments for Chagas disease. The WHO estimates that 6 to 7 million people are affected by Chagas disease worldwide. 
Elimination of sleeping sickness or a better disease management of leishmaniaisis, Buruli ulcer or Chagas disease can be considered thanks to a sustainable and global approach of the disease through this partnership.
The key to success in fighting these diseases is the need to address the multidimensional factors. The efforts of pharmaceutical companies in R&D need to be complemented by sufficient resources on the ground to identify the real needs of patients and provide them with the appropriate health care.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Dengue is a threat to nearly half of the world’s population. Currently, there is no specific treatment available for dengue. It is a public health concern in many countries of Latin America and Asia where epidemics occur regularly. The WHO estimates up to 390 million infections per year but the overall number of people infected with dengue globally is not fully known. The WHO has set the goal of estimating the true public health burden of dengue by 2015. Dengue is underreported because the disease is often misdiagnosed due to a large spectrum of clinical symptoms from mild non-specific illness to life threatening complications and because of the limitations of the surveillance systems.
Each year, 500,000 people, including children, are affected with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), the severe form of the disease. DHF is a leading cause of hospitalization, placing tremendous pressure on health systems and straining medical resources resulting in significant economic and social impact. Timely access to appropriate health care is critical to reduce the risk of mortality in case of severe dengue. The WHO has set the target to reduce dengue mortality by 50% and reduce morbidity by 25% by 2020.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi Pasteur is committed to supporting efforts in developing a comprehensive and multi-dimension approach to control the spread of Dengue disease.  Sanofi Pasteur is joining efforts with global international groups to develop an integrated, holistic approach to dengue control and to eliminate dengue as a public health problem. In addition, since 2013, Sanofi Pasteur is  participating in scientific collaborations with renowned research institutions for modelling dengue vaccination impact.
Sanofi Pasteur is also contributing to a series of initiatives from scientific seminars to community engagement activities and educational programs for school children to support the implementation of comprehensive preventive measures. This includes:
ASEAN Dengue Day (disease awareness and community engagement to help the public to identify and remove potential mosquito breeding sites, minimize exposure to mosquito bites and prevent dengue). Held every year on 15 June concurrently in all 10 member countries, ASEAN Dengue Day provides a common platform for cooperation and exchange among all stakeholders on raising dengue prevention and awareness.
Dengue Patrol Program in primary schools located in dengue hotspots together with Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health of Malaysia since 2011. The program aimed at educating students on dengue prevention and empowering them to take action in dengue prevention activities both at home and at school. The Dengue Patrol Program Since then, the program has expanded to a nationwide effort, involving more than 4,000 students in 170 schools across Malaysia. Sanofi Pasteur’s commitment is to continue the success of this campaign and broaden the reach of this program to include education and raising awareness on dengue prevention and management in 2015 and beyond in secondary school and universities.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders. Worldwide, about 50 million people live with epilepsy, nearly 80% of them in developing countries (1). Access to care is limited due to inadequate medical resources and medicines, as well as a lack of training of healthcare personnel, and stigma surrounding epilepsy.   
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Sanofi has initiated several programs in Latin America, Africa and Asia, in partnership with local authorities, health professionals, patient associations and NGOs. These programs combine training local health professionals, raising public awareness and fighting patients stigmatization. Affordable medicines are also made available through preferential pricing policies. In the countries where Sanofi implements programmes, we design preferential pricing policies, to make our medicines accessible to the most disadvantaged patients, within the framework of relevant laws and procurement procedures.
For these initiatives, Sanofi partners with:
Governmental authorities of countries where initiatives are set up, primarily Ministries of Health.
National or international Non-Governmental Organisations such as Santé Sud in Benin, Mali and Madagascar, Grarbet Tehadiso Mahber in Ethiopia, the Kenya Association for the Welfare of People with Epilepsy (KAWE), the World Health Organization for initiatives in Ghana and Vietnam (through the Sanofi Espoir Foundation).
Local or international academic teams such as the Department of Neurosciences of the University of Catania (Italy) for an initiative in Bolivia and the Institute of Neuroepidemiology and Tropical Neurology of the University of Limoges (France) for initiatives in Laos, Cambodia, Ecuador, Benin and Ethiopia.
Funding agencies such as Grand Challenges Canada for an initiative in Laos and the Comoros. 
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Sanofi epilepsy programs have been set up in the following countries: Kenya, Mali, Madagascar, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Cambodia, Laos, Bolivia, Ghana, Vietnam (the two last ones through the Sanofi Espoir Foundation). In addition, wider programs with an epilepsy component are ongoing in Morocco, Benin, Mauritania, the Comoros and Myanmar. In June 2012, in order to raise awareness about epilepsy, Sanofi launched the comic book ""We'll make it"" intended to fight exclusion of children with epilepsy.
In Kenya: support to the Kenya Association for the Welfare of people with Epilepsy (KAWE) has resumed in 2016. It will allow to train healthcare professionals from the 24 epilepsy clinics throughout the country, and to train Community Health Workers so that they can conduct awareness and educational sessions among communities. 
In Laos, more than  200 primary healthcare professionals have been  trained.
In Mali, Madagascar and Benin, the Sante Sud NGO is managing almost 6000 patients with epilepsy through a rural doctors network.
In Madagascar, more than 4 600 children have been reached with educational materials.. To date, more than 100 healthcare professionals have been trained on epilepsy.
In Ethiopia, the educational comic book on epilepsy ""We'll Make It"" was translated in Amharic and, a Knowledge Attitude and Practice survey (KAP study) was completed in Addis Ababa and in a rural high school so as to assess its impact. Results, published in Epilepsy & Behavior, indicate that the comic book is effective in reducing prejudices and improving attitudes and practices. This comic book, has now been launched in Benin, Cameroon, the Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya and Madagascar. It is available in French, English, Malagasy and Amharic. Encouraged by these results, a version for Latin America (“Guitar Heroes”) is about to be launched by Sanofi, and a comic book for India is being developed.
In Ghana the program was implemented in 10 districts and completed in 2015 with over 1010 healthcare providers and volunteers trained. In Vietnam the program was implemented in 3 provinces and 569 healthcare workers  were trained. In both countries Information Education Communication campaigns were conducted targeting traditional healers, general public, policy makers, government health service providers, NGOs, people with epilepsy and their family and public health community.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Some 450 million people in the world are affected by mental disorders (1), which are a leading cause of morbi-mortality in developing countries (2). Four mental illnesses are among the 10 leading causes of disability: major depressive episodes, disorders linked to alcohol, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (3). 
One in four people worldwide will be affected by a mental disorder at some point in their lives (4). Mental disorders are a shattering experience, not only for the individual but also for his or her family. However in developing countries, the majority of patients receive no treatment (1). Misunderstanding of the symptoms of these disorders, combined with traditional beliefs, contribute to patients being stigmatized. Inadequate human and financial resources limit access to care. The shortage of psychiatrists, specialized nurses, psychologists and social workers, the lack of training of primary healthcare professionals are among the main barriers for patients to get access to care. The availability of essential medicines is particularly low and prices often high.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
All programs address health infrastructure, access and education needs in countries in Africa, Asia, South and Central America and Europe. Focus tends to be on women and children as there are the most vulnerable groups. Specific health needs are:
Family planning
Ante and post-natal care
Malnutrition
Child vaccinations
Non communicable diseases (Asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart disease, cancer)
Communicable diseases (e.g. NTD’s including malaria, cholera)
Support for refugee communities.
Access to quality healthcare in underserved communities remains a key challenge globally. GSK programs with Save the Children aim to improve access to quality healthcare for the most underserved, whilst building a long-term, sustainable solution through educating communities on preventative health and accessing the health system, capacity building and advocacy.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Specific areas of focus are: training frontline health workers on basic preventative health education and treatments, working with communities to support them in health education and accessing the health system, developing child-friendly medicines, and advocacy for local, regional and national investment in health infrastructure and capacity building.
GSK and Save the Children are increasing access to lifesaving healthcare and improved sanitation facilities on remote islands in the Fatick region of Senegal. The project has provided health facilities with essential medical equipment and is building the capacity of community-level health workers in Fatick, supporting them to deliver improved maternal and child health care services, mobilise communities and deliver awareness-raising activities. The project is also supporting activities to achieve adequate coverage of water and sanitation facilities and improved hygiene awareness in the area to reduce the spread of water-borne and diarrhoeal diseases. More widely, the project involves advocacy at a national, regional and local level, aiming to influence policy change that will lead to greater numbers of properly trained, equipped and supported frontline health workers. Since 2012 GSK has committed over £600,000 to support this programme.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Most of the eligible women of reproductive health in the project area and indeed in Kenya have never been screened for breast or cervical cancer. There is lack of capacity of health care workers to screen for cervical and breast cancers and low community awareness on breast and cervical cancers. Hence there are Weak referral systems, poor treatment and palliative services and the marginalised community we serve
Regarding tuberculosis, the case detection rate of all TB forms stood at 75% which means 25% of TB cases are still not detected in the country.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges 
1) County Health Management Authorities (Ministry of Health) provides health staff to be trained and to carry out breast and cervical cancer screening and treatment of pre-cervical cancer and   pediatric TB
2) Ministry of Education supports implementation of awareness creation for cervical cancer in Girls secondary schools through school health program
3) Communities, Community Based Organizations, Non Governmental Organization for advocacy and social mobilization.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In the 2 years that BMSF has supported ENGAGE TB activities in Isiolo County, over 150 community health volunteers have been trained on TB, they mobilized over 6,700 members of community on TB. Over the same period 1520 adult TB contacts were traced and referred to health facilities for evaluation and diagnosis, 107 were found with TB and started on anti-TB medications.  Over 3400 malnourished children attending child health clinic and children attending occupational therapy clinic due to delayed milestones were screened and evaluated for TB (X-ray, clinical, GeneXpert), 97 were found with active TB infection and put on medication.  Breast and cervical cancer intervention is newly started and we are looking forward to creating adequate community awareness and provide access to screening and treatment of pre-cervical cancer, screening for breast cancer and referral services.

Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The institution Associação Educacional e Assistencial Casa do Zezinho, or, simply, Casa do Zezinho, is a social non-profitable organization, located near Capão Redondo, one of the most violent neighborhoods in São Paulo. Established in 1994 with the purpose of offering an activity center for children and adolescents from low-income families living in the surrounding communities, Casa do Zezinho now benefits over 1,500 Zezinhos (as 6-29 year-old children and young adults of both genders are called). Those Zezinhos, who attend over 60 public schools in the region, are engaged into educational, arts, culture, and general qualification activities, and professional certification workshops.
With the purpose of expanding services to more children and young adults, Casa do Zezinho entered into a partnership with Pfizer, to launch, in 2013, the project Se Cuida, Zezinho!, to offer to the community psychological therapy and alternative activities focused on well-being and relaxation (such as acupuncture, natural sciences, etc.). Everything is targeted to enable a full life experience for children and young adults living in the surrounding communities, who suffer with stress caused by issues like violence and drugs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
About 75% of the world’s HIV/AIDS cases are in southern Africa. Before Secure the Future® was started in 1999, 14.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa had died since the 1980s due to HIV/AIDS – more than the combined populations of New York City and Los Angeles. More than 20% of those who died were children.
While sub-Saharan Africa has only one-tenth of the world’s population, it accounted for almost 80% of all HIV/AIDS deaths worldwide before 1999 and about 70% of people living with HIV/AIDS. Life expectancy and years of ""healthy life"" were in decline and there were extraordinary numbers of orphans, leading to economic havoc and civil disorder.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 1999, BMS has invested more than USD 160 million to develop and replicate innovative and sustainable solutions for vulnerable populations, including women and children, infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The project involves NGO and IGO partners in Africa.
 This work has focused on three phases: 
Building the healthcare infrastructure (completed).
Grant-making to build the capacity of healthcare providers and communities (completed).
Transfer skills and know-how to additional countries to additional countries in sub-Saharan Africa (ongoing).
Secure The Future® is a comprehensive initiative to fight HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, sponsored by BMS and the BMS Foundation.
The program combines medical treatment and care with research, social support and training for healthcare professionals with new facilities and infrastructure investments in remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa where resources are extremely limited.
Over the past 12 years, the initiative has reached women, children, their families and communities in Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
Program support is executed by an experienced and expert pool of faculty members who have played a critical role in supporting NGOs and CBOs to provide essential services in the Community Based Treatment Support and NGO Training Institute Programs. The aim of the faculty is to develop and strengthen organizational and technical capacity and leverage and harness the potential of civil society in improve health outcomes of health programs.
Lessons learned
Since its founding in 1999, Secure The Future® has evolved and remained agile over the years in order to play as relevant a role as possible in the global response to HIV/AIDS. 
From 1999 to 2002, the program focused on broad-based grant-making to support medical research and community outreach and education. 
From 2003 to 2007, focused investments were made in community based HIV/AIDS care and treatment support, NGO training, and pediatric AIDS. 
Since 2008, Secure The Future® has been in its third phase as a technical assistance and skills transfer program. This phase capitalizes on Secure The Future's past funding, program management experience and expertise, and track record as a committed private-public partnership program. 
The aim is to replicate Secure the Future's lessons, experiences and successful models, and address a strategic challenge of operational multisectoral collaborations in HIV, mental health, TB and cervical cancer by harnessing community resources and capacity.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 1999, more than 300,000 mothers and children through the BMS Children’s Clinical Centers of Excellence or outreach sites staffed by the Pediatric AIDS Corps in partnership with Baylor College of Medicine. Over the past 15years, Secure the Future® has funded more than 240 projects in 22 African countries, with special emphasis on community treatment support programs, care for children and building health care infrastructure. It is the first and still largest corporate philanthropic commitment to fighting the disease on the continent. Working with the Baylor International Pediatrics AIDS Initiative at the Baylor College of Medicine and with governments in sub-Saharan Africa, the Foundation helped establish five Children’s Clinical Centers of Excellence in Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Uganda and Tanzania, a network of eight satellite clinics and a Pediatric AIDS Corps of pediatricians and specialists. More than 275,000 children are receiving care through this network.
The Secure the Future® Skills Transfer and Technical Assistance Program (TAP) faculty of 50 experts from across Africa includes former grant recipients and partners who have excellent community engagement and program management skills. Uniquely, TAP represents a philanthropic program that has grown in impact, even with reduced financial support, by focusing on providing South-South (Africa to Africa) skills and knowledge transfer across Africa using human resources and community-based solutions.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection among HIV/AIDS patients is a neglected problem. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the world’s HIV/TB burden is in Africa, where South Africa is ranked second to Swaziland among areas most affected. South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Democratic Republic of the Congo collectively represented more than 13% of global TB and more than one-third of the global TB/HIV co-infection burden in 2009.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In October 2011, BMS Foundation’s Secure the Future initiative and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Stop TB Department announced a partnership to leverage Secure the Future’s Technical Assistance Program faculty in sub-Saharan Africa to increase the scaling up of successful models of community TB and TB/HIV care. 
The partners work with national TB and HIV/AIDS control programs in South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to promote development of policies and programs that will enable greater involvement of NGOs and civil society organizations in TB community care and the creation of a more cost-effective and sustainable TB response.
The partnership seeks to enhance earlier detection of people with TB to ensure they are treated successfully and have better access to TB services, especially in HIV prevalent settings. TB services will be strengthened and improved by embracing the advantages that NGOs can bring, such as access to remote areas and a better understanding of local needs, especially among vulnerable groups.
The partners develop and disseminate a simplified global policy to guide national TB and HIV/AIDS programs in their efforts to improve community-based TB and TB/HIV prevention, treatment and care. They will also develop monitoring and evaluation guidelines for community-based TB and TB/HIV care, including standardized indicators and reporting formats, and will develop and disseminate a training manual on community-based TB and TB/HIV care.
Lessons learned                         
WHO cites several factors complicating past efforts to effectively address the problem of co-infection of TB and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. These include weak collaboration between civil society organizations and national TB programs for planning, coordination, supervision and sharing of data, lack of focus and poor quality of activities.
Enhancing the linkages between national treatment plans and NGOs – including the establishment of an effective monitoring and evaluation system – will be crucial to address such problems and help the scaling up of effective community-based TB and TB/HIV care.
Building capacity to function in difficult to reach and remote areas offers a unique opportunity for increased early case detection and treatment and to transform the TB prevention, care and control efforts beyond health facilities and in areas and settings where the National TB control programs cannot reach out in a systematic way (e.g., conflict zones, prisons).

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Bristol-Myers Squibb's Secure The Future® program, in partnership with Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Texas, USA), has established the BMS Children’s Clinical Centers of Excellence, a network of six clinical centers for children and families with HIV/AIDS.
The first clinical center opened in Botswana in 2003. Additional children's clinical centers are located in Lesotho, Swaziland, Uganda and Tanzania. The last center was opened in Kisumu, Kenya in 2012. These centers add capacity to fight HIV/AIDS by providing modern facilities for testing, treating and monitoring children and their families, as well as training of local health care professionals. Outreach centers are located in remote locations in Botswana, Burkina Faso, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania and Uganda.
To increase the number of trained pediatric specialists in sub-Saharan Africa, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Secure The Future® program and Baylor College of Medicine created the Pediatric AIDS Corps, which sent 50 doctors per year over five years (2006-11) to Africa to treat more than 100,000 children and train local health care professionals.
Additional Secure The Future® projects provide education, psychosocial care and support for orphans and vulnerable children, training, food security and income-generating projects for caregivers; and works to reduce stigma and encourage testing.
Lessons learned                          
The creation of the Pediatric AIDS Corp enabled Secure the Future® to stay ahead of the curve and adapt its funding priorities to the evolving situation on the ground. 
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
110,000 mothers and children have received or are receiving care through the Children’s Clinical Centers of Excellence or outreach sites, including those trained by the Pediatric Aids Corps.
128 doctors were recruited to serve in the Pediatric AIDS Corp, with a median duration of stay in Africa of 21 months.
The Pediatric AIDS Corps trained an average of 2,000 African health professionals per month over a five-year period. More than 50 outreach sites were certified and 52,000 health care workers trained.
In addition, the Pediatric Aids Corps helped reduced the annual mortality rate and increased the treatment efficacy of HIV/AIDS patients receiving HAART therapy, and improved the nutritional status for 56.3% of these patients, over a five-year period.
The last BMS Children’s Clinical Center of Excellence (Kisumu, Kenya) is scheduled to open in 2012.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has endemic HIV prevalence (>15%) and the highest (>70%) global HIV- Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection rate, primarily affecting socioeconomically disadvantaged urban and rural populations, the majority of whom are black. Patients in Gauteng Province are referred to the 3 participating hospitals. The WITS Healthcare complex serves two thirds of the Gauteng population of 13 million people that includes 3 million people from Soweto and more than a million migrants. The population has a high HIV, TB and smoking prevalence particularly among males. Because of their vulnerable status, patients experience significant morbidity and mortality. Of particular concern is the increasing incidence of lung cancer among black women, associated with increased smoking and potentially indoor air pollution from coal stoves.
Latest 2011 SA National Cancer Registry (NCR) age standardized incidence rates for lung cancer are under-reported at 11/100,000 population, as the NCR is pathology-based relying on lung tissue biopsy specimens. The most important cause of lung cancer is tobacco smoking. Large numbers of lung cancers related to asbestos and other occupational exposures (from mining), indoor biomass-fuel exposure and chronic inflammatory lung diseases – in particular tuberculosis also occur. With the successful scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART), SA is facing an epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCD’s) among aging people living with HIV/AIDS (APLWH). This population group is expected to triple by 2040 and the burden of COPD and lung cancer will increase, highlighting the need for health system planning and for burden of disease research to inform health system responses.
Lung cancer is the most common non-AIDS defining cancer among HIV-positive individuals with an incidence two to four fold higher than in HIV-negative patients, caused mainly by high prevalence of cigarette smoking among the HIV population.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Located in the North West part of South Africa, the Northern Cape Province has a population of 1.15 million inhabitants sparsely distributed over five districts and is one of the country’s poorest regions. Kimberley is the provincial capital and is within the Francis Baard District, which has a population of 387,741 people across 12, 836 km2 and a population density of 30.2 / km2. A third of the people live below the poverty line and one in ten people is illiterate.
Kuruman is a large town surrounded by asbestos mines and lies within the John Taolo Gaetsewe (JTG) District. JTG has a population of 242,264 people spanning 27,322 km2 and has a population density of 8.9 people / km2. A third of the population lives below the poverty line with as many being illiterate. More than half the province’s population lives in these two districts. Kimberley Hospital Complex (KHC) is the only facility in the Northern Cape Province with the ability to diagnose and treat lung cancer.  Kuruman Hospital is the local referral hospital for the JTG District (260km /2.5hrs from Kimberley). It has a satellite Oncology Department which is run by an Oncology trained registered nurse. It is a two roomed unit (one room for drug storage and mixing and another room for patient consultation). Due to lack of space, patients have to receive their chemotherapy in the passage/hall way.
All suspected lung cancer cases receiving care at the five district public hospitals in the Province or in the KHC specialty departments, are referred to KHC Oncology Department. The department receives and manages cases of mesothelioma and other lung cancers as well as breast, cervical, prostate and colon cancer. Currently, about 45 new lung cancer patients (13 new mesothelioma and 32 other lung cancer patients) per month are initiated on treatment.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Francophone sub-Saharan Africa has a population of 280 million people, of which about 40% is under the age of 15. Approximately 15,000 cancer cases will be diagnosed for children under the age of 15 every year. In high income countries, nearly 80% of cancers treated in the pediatric population have a chance of recovery. However, in low- and middle-income countries, there are still significant mortality numbers in pediatric patients due to lack of resources, health system malfunctions, and late diagnosis. Nearly 80% of pediatric cancers occur in these settings and 40% of pediatric cancers are diagnosed in late stages. Furthermore, there is inadequate training for healthcare professionals to appropriately treat and care for pediatric cancer.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Groupe Franco-Africain d’Oncologie Pediatrique (GFAOP) was founded in 2000 with a vision that African children with cancer could and must be treated effectively in Africa by African teams. Several projects are planned under the new Secure the Future programme which started in November 2017. As part of GFAOP’s 2025 Strategic Plan, at least 3,000 children will be cared for in sub-Saharan Francophone Africa hospital units with an early stage diagnosis. 
Project 1: Improve Early Diagnosis of Pediatric Cancers
The detection of cancer at an early stage and initiating immediate treatment increases the chance of cure and recovery. The aim of this project component is to reduce the mortality of pediatric cancers and costs of care by training and raising awareness of health staff on early diagnosis, ensuring pediatric units are adequately equipped to manage disease, and reduce delays leading to diagnosis and treatment. By disseminating information widely to parents and caregivers, it can help with raising awareness and early recognition of “warning signs” to prompt expedited consultation.
Project 2: Offer New Training for Nurses
Two types of courses will be offered to nurses - a “fundamentals” training course for nurses in pediatric oncology who have recently joined the units and an extensive one-year training course for general oncology that will lead to a university degree. The latter course will be in line with the content and teaching methods by West African Health Organization (WAHO) and will enable nurses to reach Master and Doctorate levels.
Project 3: Reinforce Multidisciplinary Care
Multidisciplinary care is crucial throughout the cancer continuum. Although there are surgeons, pathologists, and pharmacists present in all Francophone sub-Saharan African countries, they are limited in number and have competing priorities. Radiation oncologists, which are essential for at least 40% of pediatric oncology cases, are a rarity in sub-Saharan Africa. This project component plans to engage multidisciplinary staff in a 3-day meeting in Dakar ever year with a goal of 90 physicians trained on the development and implementation of cancer treatment. 
Project 4: Reduce Treatment Dropouts and Loss of Follow-up after Treatment by Strengthening Advocacy
Childhood cancers often require multiple treatments over several months and stages, causing many families to drop out of treatment. A retrospective analysis will be conducted to evaluate the dropouts for children treated for retinoblastoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, or nephroblastoma in 2016 and 2017 to understand the loss to follow-up. A support fund will be created to cover diagnosis and treatment costs for 3 selected units for a maximum of 21 months to address financial toxicities of families of pediatric patients. There will also be an increased activism for a parents’ association and advocacy groups to disseminate information on pediatric cancers, treatment compliance, and care plans.
Sustainability
The creation of a training institute in French-speaking sub-Saharan Africa will meet the current and future needs of pediatric oncology training courses in these countries. This training will create a body of nurses and specialists to improve cancer therapeutic outcomes. Advocacy associations created will also aim to sustain their organizations through raising funds, developing partnerships, and mobilizing advocates.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Malaria is one of the world’s major infectious diseases, infecting approximately 300-500 million people.  In 2012, an estimated 627,000 deaths resulted from malaria and most of the deaths occurred in children under five years old.
Artemisinin is a key ingredient in first-line malaria treatments recommended by the WHO. It is extracted from traditional Chinese medical herb Artemisia annua, but because it is extracted from plants, its supply can suffer from climatic variations, leading to unstable provision of antimalarial medicines and major price variations.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership aims at developing a complementary, semisynthetic, source of artemisinin, to improve the availability of high-quality artemisinin derivatives to drug manufacturers and contribute to stabilizing the price of artemisinin-containing antimalarials to benefit patients and payers. The original idea and the proof of concept were developed at the University of California-Berkeley, the project was then managed by the Institute for One World Health (IOWH), a nonprofit pharmaceutical company. From the proof of concept, a first chemical route was developed on a laboratory scale by Amyris Biotechnologies, a US based Biotech start-up. Sanofi was selected as the manufacturing partner, due to the malaria program within its Access to Medicines department, and because of its production and technological competences and capacity. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) provided significant financial support to this project, from its inception to its latest stages.
The partnership is managed through a board of partners that meet on a regular basis to validate the critical steps of the project’s development. Sanofi is committed to producing semisynthetic artemisinin using a no-profit, no-loss production model, helping to maintain a low price for developing countries. This is a pivotal milestone in the fight against malaria, which affects about 300 million people every year and was responsible for more than 620,000 deaths in 2012.
In April 2013, Sanofi and PATH launched an industrial production line of semisynthetic artemisinin, key ingredient of artemisinin-based combination malaria therapies (ACTs). The development of this new alternative manufacturing process to produce a complementary source of artemisinin started 9 years before.  This successful project is based upon the novel use of biology technology pioneering inventions from UC Berkeley and Amyris, in partnership with the National Research Council Canada Plant Biotechnology Institute.
Lessons learned
At Sanofi, a tremendous amount of work was done to access a scalable and cost-effective process to convert biosynthetic artemisinic acid into artemisinin, scaling-up the process to industrial scale, and ensuring production up to the highest quality standards. A large number of Sanofi staff, primarily in France and in Italy, are or were involved in this project.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2011 the industrialization phase for fermentation and chemistry was completed. In 2012 production began using the fermentation of artemisinic acid and its conversion into artemisinin using photochemistry at the Sanofi Garessio site in Italy. Sanofi plans to produce 50 to 60 tons of artemisinin per year by 2014, which corresponds to between 80 and 150 million ACT treatments.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Maintaining adequate supplies of medicines in health facilities in rural sub-Saharan Africa is a major barrier to the effective management of life-threatening diseases like malaria. Lack of visibility of medicine stock levels at the health facility level is an important contributor to this problem. Further, maternal mortality due to lack of access to blood stocks is a major problem. Bringing online visibility to these stocks seeks to alleviate this problem. 
Appropriate disease management (diagnosis and treatment) is a key part of any effective healthcare system. Lack of timely data on patient numbers, confirmed diagnosis and treatment practices is a major obstacle to monitoring progress in disease management and to taking effective improvement measures.  
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Led by Novartis and supported by public and private partners, SMS for Life was initially launched in 2009 to help prevent stock-outs of antimalarials in Tanzania. SMS for Life has since been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in Kenya, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. Over the years, the scope of the program has also expanded to more disease areas and health parameters.
Building on the success of SMS for Life, a new enhanced version, SMS for Life 2.0 was launched in 2016. 
How the system works:
The solution is based on the use of simple and affordable technologies (mobile phones, SMS messages, smartphones and tablet computers, the Internet and electronic mapping) so that health facilities that dispense essential medicines can report their stock levels and key disease surveillance indicators to the district medical officers who are responsible for treatment availability.
In addition to stock visibility, the system enables to collect timely and quality disease surveillance data, hence allowing all levels in the health pyramid (districts, regions, national malaria control programs, ministries of health) to monitor and support the operations in the primary health facilities – ultimately making fact-based decisions to better assess the adequacy of the resource allocation with the actual needs. Stock-outs can thus be resolved in 2-3 days whereas in the past this would have taken one or two months.
The tablet-based platform also offers high-quality training programs and educational video resources to support the continuous education of health workers.
The data collected by SMS for Life can be integrated into a country’s health information system and strategy. Implementation is tailored to the specific needs and priorities of individual countries, and the system is flexible, meaning it can be expanded to any number of health facilities, countries, programs, stock items or disease surveillance data.
To date, SMS for Life (phone-based version) has been rolled out in more than 10,000 public health facilities in Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon.
In Tanzania, with support from Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and Population Services International (PSI), SMS for life was implemented in the country’s 5,100 health facilities. This project was also supported by the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, IBM, Google, Vodafone and Vodacom. Tracking of tuberculosis and leprosy medicines, funded by the Novartis Foundation, has also been added.
In Kenya, Novartis supported the completion of an extensive pilot together with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP).
In Ghana, following a successful pilot in six districts, sponsored by the Swiss TPH Institute, we worked with the Ghana Health Service on a full country scale-up. The system is also tracking 28 blood products from the National Blood Transfusion Service and from 10 regional hospitals in the greater Accra region. The online information on availability of blood products has helped reduce maternal mortality in child birth from hemorrhage.
The platform was rolled out in Cameroon across more than 3,000 facilities to track malaria medicines and collect patient surveillance data in 2015.
In an initiative led by the President’s Malaria Initiative and rolled out by Greenmash, SMS for Life was implemented in five provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1,245 health facilities). Further, the solution was also used to track bed nets, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and disease surveillance data, as well as antibiotics, medicines against leprosy and tuberculosis, and blood supplies.
SMS for Life has proven to work and be effective in both the multi-country pilots and country scale-ups where thousands of health facility workers have now been reporting their medicine stocks on a weekly basis for some years. Bringing visibility to the stock levels on a weekly basis has proven to have a direct impact on better medicine stock management, reduction of stock-outs and a consequent increase in access to medicines at the remote health facility level. The main innovation and contribution of the program has been to design and develop an enterprise standard, in the form of a fully scalable, expandable and sustainable solution, which can be offered at an affordable price to resource-poor countries. The infrastructure, which has shown to work in the difficult target environment, now exists and is supported by at least three industry-leading technology suppliers the SMS for Life team has worked with.
SMS for Life 2.0:
Building on the success of SMS for Life, a new enhanced version, SMS for Life 2.0 was launched in 2016 in Kaduna State, Nigeria’s third most populous region, together with the Kaduna State Ministry of Health and Vodacom. The new program addresses key operational challenges at peripheral healthcare facilities (dispensaries, health posts, healthcare and medical centers) in Kaduna State.
Using smartphones and tablet computers, local healthcare workers can track stock levels of essential antimalarials, vaccines, and HIV, TB and leprosy treatments, and send notifications to district medical officers when stock levels are low. Tablet computers also allow for disease monitoring by supporting data collection of basic disease parameters in line with a country’s needs. The program also monitors surveillance parameters of malaria, maternal and infant deaths and seven other diseases, including measles, yellow fever and cholera. In addition, SMS for Life 2.0 enables training of healthcare workers in local facilities using on-demand eLearning modules that support continuous education. These resources can also be used to increase public awareness on health topics.
In addition to the launch in Nigeria, Novartis and its non-profit partner Right to Care signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016 with the Zambian Ministry of Health to deploy SMS for Life 2.0 in up to 2,000 health facilities across the country. The program, which will include stock reporting, disease surveillance and eLearning, will be supported by Vodacom and is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2017.
SMS for Life 2.0 is also under discussion in other sub-Saharan countries. Further, the system could be extended to treatments against noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes or high-blood pressure.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In the Philippines, there is limited public funding of healthcare and only a section of the working population have medical insurance plans through their employers. As a result, 57% of health expenses are out-of-pocket. The government-owned Philippine Healthcare Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) provides basic national healthcare coverage, however, it doesn’t include biologic cancer treatment.
Biologics is a relatively new class of drugs that includes Herceptin (trastuzumab), a Roche targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.  It is estimated that only 6% of the relevant patients have access to innovative cancer therapy and adherence to full-course treatment remains a challenge.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
The Roche Patient Access Programme was established to help people who are financially constrained, through a socialised pricing program that considers the individual affordability level of a patient. Physicians refer patients to the programme, who are then assessed by an independent third party for their ability to pay. Qualified patients receive a discount or free product for products like Herceptin, Avastin, MabThera, Perjeta, and Tarceva based on their financial status. This initiative pricing improves access to products for poorer patients without impacting the price for patients able to pay out of pocket.
In addition to these programmes, Roche Philippines is working with both national and local government units to mobilise funding for cancer patients 
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
By implementing the patient assistance programmes, the number of patients who are now able to access innovative cancer treatment has increased by 23% in 2015. Furthermore, the ability of patients to complete the full treatment duration has increased significantly.

According to the International Diabetes Federation, nearly one in two (46%) of the 415 million adults living with diabetes are unaware that they have the condition. Most of these cases are type 2 diabetes.
In Brazil, according to Sociedade Brasileira de Diabetes (Brazilian Diabetes Society), there are more than 13 million people living with diabetes, which represents 6.9% of the population - and that number is growing. In some cases, the diagnosis is delayed, which can be a factor for complications.
Sanofi Diabetes has provided several services for patients with diabetes over a long period of time. In 2012, the company decided to consolidate all initiatives towards the same goal, putting the patient at the very heart of an online platform called ""StarBem Mais Program"".
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges

            Partnership objectives Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Stop TB Partnership was established in 2000 to realize the goal of eliminating tuberculosis (TB) as a public health problem. It comprises a network of more than 500 international, governmental, nongovernmental and private sector organizations and individuals with an interest in working together to achieve this goal. The Partnership is a global movement to accelerate social and political action to stop the spread of TB around the world. A number of IFPMA members, including AstraZeneca, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Lilly, Novartis, and Pfizer are currently partners of the Stop TB Partnership and/or actively contribute to its aims and programs.
The partnership develops advocacy and resource mobilization strategies in support of these priorities, and coordinates and 'brokers' resource flows. In addition, there are six Working Groups that contribute significantly to the achievement of partnership aims: DOTS Expansion Working Group; TB-HIV Working Group; Stop TB Working Group on MDR-TB; Working Group on New TB Drugs, Working Group on New TB Diagnostics and Working Group on New TB Vaccines.
The Stop TB Partnership Private Sector Constituency is the community of businesses with a recognized role or interest in TB control. The Private Sector has been represented on the Coordinating Board of the Global Stop TB Partnership since 2004, following a proposal by the World Economic Forum.
The Global Drug Facility, run by the Stop TB Partnership, is expanding access to medicines for DOTS scale up; in just 5 years it has committed over 7 million TB treatments. Projects managing MDR-TB can apply through the Green Light Committee (GLC) for access to quality MDR-TB medicines at reduced prices - in some cases by as much as 99%. The Committee is operated by WHO and the Stop TB Partnership. Lilly has a program to make two critical medicines for treatment of drug-resistant strains available in developing countries and will supply 1.4 million vials of capreomycin at concessionary prices to the GLC in 2009. Novartis is donating 500,000 fixed dose combinations to all adult patients in Tanzania through the Global Drug Facility during 2005-2012. To improve access and treatment compliance, the Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development together with the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare introduced a patient-centered treatment approach, offering TB patients the choice whether to take the treatment at a health facility or at home, observed by a family member (DOT- directly observed treatment). Early 2016, Otsuka committed to enhancing access to delamanid for treating multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in low- and middle-income countries. The company will moreover support communities with education, training, technical assistance, and TB advocacy activities.

One of the greatest healthcare challenges for Africa is having enough trained healthcare workers to manage diagnostic tools effectively. 50-70% of clinical decisions depend on accurate laboratory diagnosis, so having reliable diagnostic capabilities is critical.
Optimising the use of diagnostics will be critical to achieving the targets of the UNAIDS 90:90:90 goal by 2020. This goal means that 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have durable viral suppression.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To address the lack of trained diagnostic workers and laboratory capacity, Roche opened the Roche Scientific Campus in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2012. The training centre aims to provide:
hands-on, certified training courses for lab technologists and engineers
general lab management training for managers and policy makers
education on health and scientific topics for healthcare professionals and scientists
The facility boasts five self-contained laboratories with the latest technological tools in chemistry, haematology, molecular biology, tissue diagnostics and sequencing. Training is conducted by certified trainers and experts, in collaboration with local and international organisations.
In 2012 Roche and the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) formed a five-year partnership to strengthen training for diagnostics workers in Africa. In 2014, Roche extended its partnership with Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), (PEPFAR), and the Global Fund to fight HIVAIDS, TB & Malaria on a new Global Access Program for HIV viral load testing. The Global Access Program specifically addresses the need for increased diagnostic testing and viral load assays with reduced pricing in those countries most impacted by HIV. This includes improving laboratory capacity to ensure that all people living with HIV can be linked to effective, high-quality HIV treatment services.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
To date the campus has hosted over 300 courses, covered over 980 training days for around 1600 participants. The facility also plays regular host to HIV clinicians and meetings on various topics. The roll-out of the PEPFAR-Roche partnership began with two pilot courses; a five-day laboratory budgeting course, followed by a two-week course on Method Validation and Quality Control.

India was chosen as the first geographic focus since it has the third highest number of deaths due to stroke globally. It is estimated that there are over one million strokes per year in this largest base of the pyramid (BoP) population in the world, with 200 million urban and 700 million rural poor. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The initiative has made it its main objective to develop new scalable integrated models that reduce the incidence and burden of stroke in underserved populations. To achieve these goals, the Innovation Lab is based on three principles:
Collaboration - the Innovation Lab is a collaborative, open process that brings together multiple perspectives and experiences, including health experts, NGOs and companies. Working groups on various stroke-related topics will help shape the guidelines for field testing.
Synergies - any information and research arising from Innovation Lab activities will be shared among all participants and, where possible, the public domain, in order to increase synergies, innovation and cross-pollination of ideas.
Systems impact - the Innovation Lab is targeted towards transforming health systems. Improving access to health for local populations is complex and requires solutions beyond the mere treatment in order to create an enabling environment, where health-conscious behaviour is supported and individuals as well as communities are cared for appropriately.
The initiative will consists of approximately two years of field testing.

The rise in antimicrobial resistance over the past 10 years has become one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. An estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths are thought to be caused by antibiotic resistance in the U.S. each year. Our company’s long-standing commitment to the global fight against infectious disease goes hand-in-hand with a commitment to help slow the rate of emergence of potentially deadly resistant organisms.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The SMART program is one of the world’s largest programs for tracking trends in antimicrobial resistance. Over 200,000 clinical samples have been collected from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections since 2002 and from patients with complicated urinary tract infections since 2010, and analyzed for their in vitro susceptibility to 12 commonly used antibiotics in different regions of the world to monitor changing trends in antibiotic susceptibility. Currently, 192 hospital sites in 54 countries participate in SMART.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that is transmitted to humans by a mosquito bite. Once transmitted, it causes lymphatic dysfunction that leads to other serious physical disabilities such as elephantiasis. Currently, the disease still affects an estimated 120 million people in 73 countries worldwide, mostly in developing and emerging nations in Africa and Southeast Asia.
Lymphatic filariasis can be treated with a combination of two anti-parasitic agents including diethycarbamazine (“DEC”). Large-scale interventions in which all inhabitants of endemic areas are administered DEC once a year for at least five years is effective in eliminating the disease. As of December 2016, Eisai has delivered 850 million tablets for 27 countries.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The current insufficient supply of DEC has hindered global elimination efforts. As a global pharmaceutical company committed to improving health of all individuals worldwide, Eisai has decided to manufacture and supply DEC free of charge to WHO, facilitating achievement of the 2020 elimination target. Eisai will provide the WHO up to 2.2 billion 100mg tablets of DEC in accordance with WHO’s high quality standards over seven years beginning in 2013. Production of the medicine is conducted at Eisai's Vizag Plant in India.
Eisai developed the formulation and conducted bioequivalence studies before submitting its application to WHO for prequalification in October 2012. After a relatively smooth evaluation process, Eisai was able to receive prequalification for the DEC tablets less than 10 months from submission of the application. The prequalification was a crucial milestone that will see Eisai deliver “Eisai-original,” high-quality DEC tablets to 250 million people living in at-risk communities in countries where lymphatic filariasis is endemic, thereby contributing to successful elimination of the disease.
Together with supplying DEC tablets to WHO, Eisai has assigned internal “DEC Project Managers” who are responsible for planning and execution of lymphatic filariasis elimination activities. The majority of staff appointed as DEC Project Managers are from Eisai subsidiaries in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries throughout Asia, and they discuss with government officials in charge of lymphatic filariasis as well as other relevant stakeholders in other regions what way can we contribute to the early realization of elimination from a local perspective.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. The EVD case fatality rate of the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak was around 50%; the average rate in past outbreaks has varied from 25% to 90%.
Since the discovery of the virus in 1976, random and contained outbreaks of Ebola, mainly in Central Africa, resulted in an average 250 cases and 40 deaths annually. From March 2014 to March 2016, West Africa experienced the largest Ebola outbreak in history, with more than 28,000 estimated cases and 11,000 fatalities. Previous EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests, but the recent outbreak in West Africa involved major urban as well as rural areas.
Beyond the personal tragedy for individuals and their families, the outbreak put a severe strain on health workers, health systems and the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as a whole. On 8 April 2014, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola Outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 
While Ebola is an extremely contagious disease, isolating sick patients and applying precautionary measures in healthcare settings — wearing gloves, gowns, and masks — helped stop the spread of the disease. Symptoms of Ebola can be confused for malaria, typhoid, cholera, the flu and other diseases. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is a problem without the appropriate diagnostic tools. Serious gaps in the physical health and sanitation infrastructure in affected countries as well as gaps in primary health services promulgated the spread of the disease. The longer the delay in referral to hospital for rehydration treatment, the lower the chance of survival.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Pharmaceutical companies were deeply concerned by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and the devastating impact this outbreak had on those living in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Several IFPMA pharmaceutical companies have been involved in efforts to develop Ebola vaccines. For more information on research and development activities of some of these companies, refer to profiles for GSK, J&J and MSD. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies made financial contributions to support organisations and health workers at the front-line of the crisis. As of mid-October, 2014:
GSK donated $690,000 in cash contributions for the three most affected countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. These donations include $562,000 to Save the Children, a long-standing partner in the region, to scale up work with frontline healthcare workers to maintain the delivery of essential health services and tackle the outbreak of Ebola. GSK also made donations of $64,000 each to humanitarian partners, AmeriCares and Direct Relief to enable these organisations to purchase and deliver critical supplies of personal protection equipment (PPE). Alongside this, GSK significantly increased medicine donations, with donated GSK products worth more than $1,122,500 to partners AmeriCares and Project HOPE.
As well as providing humanitarian support to affected regions, GSK accelerated the development of its candidate vaccine for Ebola at an unprecedented rate, with trials now underway.
GSK fast tracked development of the Ebola vaccine with many organisations, including the National Institutes of Health in the USA, the WHO, the Wellcome Trust and the UK Government. Learning from this experience GSK closely monitored the outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil.
In January 2017 a new partnership launched to help develop new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases before they become global health emergencies – GSK is actively involved in The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). This partnership seeks to learn from experiences with the Ebola outbreak and find ways to stimulate, coordinate and fund the development of vaccines against epidemic threats.

Johnson & Johnson committed to a cash contribution of $1,000,000 to help advance health care worker safety and effectiveness in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Liberia, the company provided funds to Direct Relief, which provided emergency relief services in response to the outbreak, and to Partners in Health to provide community health worker training. In Guinea, Johnson & Johnson  funded AmeriCares and IntraHealth, while in Sierra Leone, the company funded AmeriCares and Direct Relief. The company  also provided funds to Project HOPE to focus efforts in support of infection control training regions in Liberia and Sierra Leone. To build long-term capacity for vaccine development and clinical trial evaluation in Sierra Leone, Johnson & Johnson continues to support efforts to train local staff and helped in partnership efforts to establish a vaccine depot, a research laboratory and an emergency room at the local hospital in the Kambia District of the country.
Novartis worked with local business operations in affected regions, committed about $1,000,000 to the Red Cross and matched amounts raised by a global donation program among employees. The donations helped Red Cross work on the ground in the most affected areas, including construction of a treatment center in Sierra Leone. Associates  contributed more than $160,000 to the effort initiated by Novartis’ chairman.
Bayer made medicines with a market value of $3.2 million available to Direct Relief free of charge to treat Ebola patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Bayer thus boosted its assistance in tackling the epidemic, having already provided immediate relief in the form of medicines and monetary donations worth $32,000 to Caritas international directly after the outbreak. 
Pfizer and the Pfizer Foundation provided $525,000 in funding to help combat Ebola. Pfizer Inc. provided a $25,000 grant to Direct Relief to support transportation of medical supplies and $500,000 in grants from the Pfizer Foundation went to the following organizations supporting treatment and surveillance: Centers for Disease Control’s Global Disaster Response, International Medical Corps, the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, and Save the Children. The Pfizer Foundation is a charitable organization established by Pfizer Inc. It is a separate legal entity from Pfizer Inc. with distinct legal restrictions. 
AbbVie Foundation approved grants of $500,000 (Direct Relief International, AmeriCares, International Medical Corps, MAP, Partners in Health) to support Ebola response efforts on the ground in West Africa. Funding was used to help enable the immediate mobilization of resources including medical products and personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of this epidemic and address the urgent needs of healthcare workers and people affected by Ebola throughout the region. 
AstraZeneca donated $403,000 through the British Red Cross Ebola Appeal to support the work local Red Cross agencies to contain and prevent further outbreaks in the countries worst hit by the Ebola outbreak. AZ also worked to screen a number of their compounds to explore their potential as treatments for Ebola. 
Merck donated $313,150 to the German Red Cross to support local aid workers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Lone. This money also went towards an enhanced treatment center of the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone. In Liberia, the German Red cross, with support of the German military, operated a treatment center for Ebola patients from mid-November. 
MSD (known as Merck & Co., Inc. in the USA and Canada) partnered with the International Medical Corps to build, staff and provide training on effective Ebola isolation units and referral systems in Bong County’s Phebe and C.B. Dunbar Hospitals in Liberia. As of April 2016, a total of 180,589 patients, staff, visitors and caretakers have been successfully screened at Phebe and CB Dunbar hospital Screening and Referral Units (SRUs). In total, 49 patients were identified as meeting Ebola-suspect definition and referred to the Bong Ebola Treatment Unit for Ebola testing. Based on the success of the program, and with the support of and at the request of the Ministry of Health, and with co-funding support, International Medical Corps was able to expand its training and infrastructure efforts from the original two facilities to a total of 11 facilities across Bong, Margibi and Montserrado Counties in Liberia. International Medical Corps completed the transition of the temporary SRU structures to permanent structures at C.B. Dunbar and Phebe Hospital as of the end of April 2016.
In addition, MSD has made product donations through partners Direct Relief and their local NGO in Sierra Leone, the Wellbody Alliance. MSD has sent Medical Mission Packs through MAP International. MAP indicated that these mission packs have proven a useful mechanism to disburse donated products widely, especially in the Ebola-affected areas. In Liberia, MAP partnered with the Ministry of Health on distribution and in Sierra Leone, with Christian Relief Services. The value of the MSD products included in the packs is $523,400. MSD has also made a cash contribution to Direct Relief of $25,000 to support the transport of medical supplies to the region and $63,000 to Project Hope to conduct a Phase I assessment in Sierra Leone to determine specific strategy to stop the spread of the virus and prevent future outbreaks.  
Sanofi Foundation donated $128,000 via the Red Cross “Ready Fund”. 
Lilly provided an unrestricted donation of $100,000 to two trusted organizations working on Ebola relief ($50,000 to Direct Relief International and $50,000 to Project HOPE). Both organizations worked to deliver the necessary supplies to Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. Direct Relief provided emergency shipments to partners, as well as emergency medical assistance, inLiberia andSierra Leone. Project Hope deployed a six-member team to Freetown, Sierra Leone to support the country in combating the Ebola outbreak. Lilly employees, along with a Lilly Foundation match through Global Giving, donated to date more than $30,000 to Ebola relief efforts. In addition, Lilly assessed the potential of any molecules currently in its pipeline that could help treat Ebola, indexing its viral library for potential treatments. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb donated $50,000 to the non-profits International Rescue Committee and Direct Relief in September 2014. BMS matched dollar donations that its employees in the United States and Puerto Rico made to non-profit disaster relief organizations responding to the epidemic. 
Abbott and Abbott Fund provided more than $25,000 in product donations and funding support for organizations providing care and treatment on the ground in affected countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Key partner organizations included AmeriCares, Direct Relief, Heart to Heart International and Partners In Health, and donated products included Abbott’s Point of Care i-STAT handheld diagnostics system and cartridges, as well as medicines and medical products. 
Takeda made a donation to the Japanese Red Cross Society to support the International Red Cross emergency relief activities in West Africa. Takeda also donated in cash to the Ebola Response Fund (through the Wits Health Consortium (Pty) Limited, owned by the Witwatersrand University in South Africa) in order to train, support and send five qualified nurses to work at the South African field hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
Diagnostics tools
Roche, under a worldwide exclusive agreement with TIB MOBIOL, distributed the LightMix Modular Ebola Virus Zaire Assay, optimized to run on Roche's LightCycler systems. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Roche's LightMix Ebola Zaire rRT-PCR Test for use on patients with signs and symptoms of Ebola Zaire virus infection. The diagnostic tool can generate results in three hours and allow for more rapid treatment of infected patients.
Janssen Diagnostics (a division of Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson), Biocartis NV (Biocartis), and the Belgium Institute of Tropical Medicine jointly developed the Idylla™ Ebola Virus Triage Test, which was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2016. The diagnostic detects the presence of the Ebola Zaire virus in patients with signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease. The Idylla™ Ebola Virus Triage delivers results within 100 minutes and requires minimal training to interpret the results.

Vulnerable children can have worse outcomes later in their lives. They have more health problems, poorer education and employment outcomes and even increased rates of criminal activity and incarceration. They can be found in many countries, particularly in least developed countries.
Malawi is a peaceful and stable country, but it is also one of the least developed countries in the world. Almost half the population is younger than 15 years old and half a million children have been orphaned due to HIV/AIDS. Forty percent of the population live on less than US$ 1 per day and there are close to 250,000 acutely malnourished children below the age of five.
Seventy-five percent of children are unable to access secondary school education. Yet evidence has shown that getting and keeping young people in school, particularity girls, can dramatically decrease their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS infection.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Every year, Roche employees join together for the Roche Children’s Walk to raise essential funds for vulnerable children worldwide. The money raised is matched by Roche and goes towards supporting projects connected to children around the world, with a focus on improving the lives of individuals and communities, both now and for a sustainable future. 
Over half of the money is used to help support HIV/AIDS orphaned children in Malawi through projects run by Roche’s partner organisations – the European Coalition of Positive People (ECPP) and UNICEF Switzerland. 
The funds raised have helped to implement and support the running and equipping of much needed orphan centres by ECPP where children are given food, clothing, practical skills training and the chance of a secondary school education. The children also receive training in skills such as tin-smithing, carpentry and knitting. Local community leaders and villagers are trained to competently manage these centres by ECPP, encouraging self-reliance amongst the communities we help. 
A further share of the funds are used by UNICEF to support primary education by building classrooms, improving facilities and providing learning materials.  Roche is also supporting UNICEF to build a teachers training college that will house more than 500 new local teachers by 2017, helping future generations in Malawi benefit from an education.
Roche’s support aims to encourage self-sustainability by helping local communities develop the skills and knowledge which will improve their lives today, and for future generations to come.  Education, along with proper nutrition and health, are the pillars of a sustainable society and critical necessities in developing countries.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since 2003, five orphan centers in Malawi have been equipped and 17,000 orphan children in Malawi have been supported. Furthermore, the funds have been able to:
Provide 5,600,000 meals, 300,000 school uniforms and 6,000 books;
Build 18 classrooms to create better learning environments;
Provide over 2,000 orphaned children with primary health care;
Support over 1,000 with secondary education;
Train 200 students who are now student teachers;
Develop practical skills such as carpentry, tin-smithing and tailoring for 4,000 children.
As local affiliates can use up to 50% of the raised donations for local children projects, over 90 additional local organisations are supported all around the world, including foundations, charities, hospitals, children’s homes, schools, hospices and orphanages. 
By continuing to support these projects through this annual fundraising event, Roche aims to make permanent sustainable change for vulnerable children in Malawi, and other countries around the world.

            Partnership objectives
Contribute to the sustainable reduction of maternal mortality by promoting a partnership between health authorities and communities organized around mutual health insurance schemes.
Design mechanisms for supporting pregnant women, coordinated with mutual health insurance schemes and free-of-charge schemes created by the health authorities to reduce the barriers to accessing health services and effectively allowing them to enjoy the free health care they need.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The Prefectures of Beyla, Yomou and Gouécké in Forested Guinea the Republic of Guinea, and the Pala and Gounou Gaya prefectures in the Region of Mayo Kebi in have some of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world.
Probability that a pregnant woman dies during childbirth is Forested Guinea 4.5% and Chad 1.1%. In Forested Guinea, a woman has a one in four chance of dying during the average of six pregnancies she will have during her lifetime, and one in 14 in the Mayo Kebbi in Chad.
Less than one in every four women give birth in a health center in Mayo Kebi in Chad and in Forested Guinea.
In an attempt to reduce these devastating maternal mortality figures, the Governments of both countries have opened up free maternal healthcare services. However, the expected increase in the number of women agreeing to give birth in health centers did not materialize, due to the many barriers to access to health centers and hospitals: the lack of vehicles, high transportation costs in emergencies, the unpredictability of the amount to be paid despite the free service announced by the State, deeply-rooted cultural practices that often force women to give birth in their village, and a style of reception in health centers and hospitals that tends to demean women.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To remove these barriers, communities need to be aided, and measures taken to ensure safety for women and an understanding that giving birth does not entail a risk of dying.
To achieve this, the International Center for Development and Research (CIDR) has proposed to communities of Forested Guinea organized in mutual organizations to benefit from services that enable them to reduce the risk women incur of dying during her pregnancy because she decided to give birth in the village by offering them ""a ""Safe Maternity"" services package. This will train midwives to handle early referrals, organize prenatal visits in the villages, plan for the monitored delivery of high-risk pregnancies, call an ambulance in an emergency, and monitor effective, free-of-charge healthcare.
To benefit from these services, the villages must commit contractually to educate women and contribute to the costs. Highly significant outcomes have already been obtained with this approach, and this project plans to evaluate its impact shortly.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
This project will involve:
Seven new mutual schemes will be created and 17 mutual schemes will promote the ""Safe Motherhood"" approach.
The liability of 60,000 women of childbearing age living in 90 villages will be reduced.
And 30,000 pregnant women will be able to have their pregnancy monitored near their own village, be encouraged by their midwife to give birth in a health center, benefit from a solution for evacuating them to a hospital in case of complications and receive proper care delivered by health services.
As of now, villages that belong to the ""Safe Motherhood"" program have seen the recorded maternal mortality rate has been reduced 10-fold, and the birth rate has doubled. The results of the program will be monitored and reported to the health authorities so that the approach can be developed beyond the scope of this project.

Tanzania is one of the larger countries in Africa, covering nearly one million square kilometers and home to more than 40 million people, most of whom living in rural areas. Its health sector is mainly defined by underfunding, resulting in lack of health services and inadequately trained medical personnel. There are currently less than 1,000 registered pharmacists, with only about 135 pharmaceutical technicians and 30 pharmaceutical assistants graduating each year.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The program aims to establish an efficient healthcare system through an appropriate infrastructure, well-trained medical staff and quality control.
For this reason, the program supports the Kilimanjaro School of Pharmacy in Moshi in improving the scope and quality of their training courses for assistant pharmaceutical staff. The pilot project consists of assisting in the launch of a new dispenser course, by facilitating the development of required documents, like assessment plans or the standard training manual for pharmaceutical assistants and technicians. Additionally, it entails providing funding for the harmonization of curricula and training materials with the criteria of the National Council for Technical Education.

"386","Survey of antibiotic resistance (SOAR)","
        
        
            Program Objectives
GSK has been involved in antibiotic surveillance studies since 1992, when it ran The Alexander Project (1992-2001), GSK's first international surveillance study of community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CA-RTIs). In 2002, GSK began the Survey of Antibiotic Resistance (SOAR) study.
SOAR focuses on the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, which are a major burden for healthcare systems. This includes pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
SOAR tracks the effectiveness of the most commonly-used antibiotics (beta-lactams, cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones), based on three different breakpoints, through a quantitative method for determining antibiotic susceptibility in areas where resistance data can be scarce and more is needed to understand the local trends and inform appropriate prescribing. Studies cover the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Common Wealth of Independent States, Asia, China and Eastern Europe.
GSK proactively publishes this data and shares it with healthcare professionals and public health bodies to provide country specific resistance levels to inform prescribing and guideline development.

GSK recognises that it is important to understand local resistance patterns in order to help encourage appropriate antibiotic usage and vaccination strategies and to minimise the development of further resistance. GSK is building surveillance data that tracks antibiotic resistance over time and geographies.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In the next SOAR cycle, data is being collected from 2014-2016 in 16 centres, across 11 countries: Argentina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, and the Ukraine. The results of this SOAR cycle are expected to be published in 2017.  
Additionally, SOAR 2015-2017 is running in 54 centres, across 31 countries: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rico, Trinidad & Tobago, Jamaica, Chile, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Botswana, Mauritius, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, the Philippines and Singapore. The results of this expanded programme are expected to be published in 2018.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
India has a population of 1 billion with 70% of its population living in rural areas. Yet, urban areas account for approximately 70% of the hospital beds and 80% of healthcare professionals. There is approximately 15 times more beds per 1000 people in urban areas compared to rural areas.
Population in rural areas is expected to increase to 906 million by 2025. But doctors do not wish to serve in rural areas due to the lack of basic amenities and incentives. Hence a shortage of specialists and surgical services in rural areas, and an increasing disparity between urban and rural infrastructures.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This project targets rural populations in India, focusing on awareness and access to primary healthcare, women and children's health, and prevention. Engagement is done through community-level meetings and weekly educative health programs by healthcare professionals.
Local GPs are also given educative sessions through Continuous Medical Education (CME), with the support of town healthcare professionals. The project is carried out in partnership with international NGOs such as AED and Clinton Foundation. There are currently discussions with USAID and the Indian National Rural Health Mission regarding their participation in the project.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Pilots were initiated in small towns of two Eastern provinces of India (Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) with a focus on small ailments such as cough and cold, women and children’s health, as well as everyday health protection. Products are identified and prices are adapted as per the needs of consumers in target areas.
Access to primary healthcare in target areas has increased following the distribution of referral cards enabling patients to reach doctors in their areas and loyalty programs allow patients to have free consultations with local dispensing GPs.
Since April 2013, an additional 1976 towns and villages have benefited from the program (including diarrhea management and access to safe drinking water), translating in an additional 190,000 patients reached.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
According to the Red Cross, tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious disease, kills almost two million people each year. Patient failure to complete long and complex TB treatment creates resistance to future treatment programs, and co-existence of TB and HIV form a potentially lethal combination, each speeding the other’s progress.
TB is the leading cause of death among people who are HIV positive. For those affected by TB and HIV, stigma, poverty and poor access to services are added problems that challenge the successful completion of TB treatment.
A significant problem in the treatment of TB is not the availability of effective medicines, but the fact that treatment regimens are long and complicated. This means that many patients give up the treatment once the symptoms are no longer apparent, but before the infection is fully treated. This can lead to relapse which makes drug resistance more likely. Encouraging patients to finish their course of treatment is therefore critical.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The British Red Cross Society and AstraZeneca work together to provide community based programs that promote TB and TB/HIV awareness and education, encouraging people to seek early diagnosis, improve patient compliance, provide care in the home and address the stigma associated with the diseases. Through these programs, Red Crescent nurses monitor TB patients’ living conditions and health status through home visits and undertake refresher training on Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) strategy, psycho-social support and first aid tools.
The program offers motivation for sufferers to complete treatment by distributing hygiene parcels, recruiting former TB patients as support group leaders, who also help reduce associated stigma and encourage early diagnosis and involving former beneficiaries of the program in self-support groups and psychosocial counseling.
TB awareness campaigns and educational activities are also distributed through newspaper articles, TV broadcasts, secondary school visits and student peer education sessions.
Lessons learned
Visits to patients’ homes help nurses assess living conditions and reasons that patients might default on treatment.
Individual counseling helps patients with problems arising both directly and indirectly from the disease.
Earlier diagnosis is enabled amongst immigrant and migrant populations byoffering free X-ray service and awareness raising activities.
The ability for sufferers to support themselves is enhanced by lawyers and social workers assisting with employment, identity cards, disability documentation and restoration of lost housing entitlement.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
In South Africa:
The South African Red Cross Society (SARCS) is helping to deliver improved care and support to people living with TB or TB/HIV in 10 areas. To date, some 2,500 people affected by TB or TB/HIV have successfully completed their treatment and over 6,000 suspected cases of TB identified and sent for screening. 160 Red Cross volunteers have been trained in TB management and prevention, including how to recognise TB symptoms.
In Central Asia:
Over 10,000 people living with TB or TB/HIV successfully completed their TB treatment and TB treatment completion rates reached 89% and 92% in Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan respectively. A significant increase in community awareness following media campaigns and health education sessions in schools and public places reached nearly 2 million people.

For millions of people in low and middle-income countries parasites and the deadly infections they cause pose a constant threat to health and survival. However, many of the infectious diseases caused by parasites are neglected and few treatments are available. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
A team led by researchers at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) has identified a potential way to tackle three neglected diseases at once. The scientists are able to show that a single compound can cripple the parasites responsible for African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, which cause symptoms in close to 1 million people per year. 
The three diseases, responsible for 50,000 deaths annually, seem quite distinct. African sleeping sickness is found in Africa and affects the central nervous system. Leishmaniasis is a skin infection that leads to skin and mouth sores and is prevalent across Asia, Africa and Latin America.  Chagas disease occurs mostly in Latin America, but can also be found in the U.S. and Europe. These infections, which often go unnoticed at first, can eventually cause intestinal complications and heart failure.
However, these three infections have one thing in common. They are all caused by parasites that belong to the same class of single-celled organisms—the kinetoplastids. This common feature led the team at GNF to search for a shared weakness.
In search of a shared weakness, more than three million compounds were tested until scientists at GNF found one, GNF5343, which stood out as a promising lead. Following this discovery, a chemistry team took this compund and made it more potent and more like a drug candidate. When the team tested the optimized version of GNF5343 in mice with the three kinetoplastid diseases, the animals were cured of their infection.

TTCIH is one of the Novartis Foundation’s earliest programs, addressing the shortage of human resources. The goal for TTCIH was to become an autonomous, self-reliant social enterprise, providing high-quality training, services and facilities for healthcare professionals. While it is based in rural Tanzania, its programs now benefit healthcare systems across Africa and beyond.
The Novartis Foundation’s partners include the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.
Apart from being a funding partner, the Novartis Foundation has played a key role in bringing corporate expertise in areas such as business management, financial analysis, marketing and human resources that are helping TTCIH become a stronger sustainable social enterprise.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Despite significant progress in combatting tuberculosis (TB), TB remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to WHO, in 2014 TB killed 1.5 million people (1.1 million HIV-negative and 0.4 million HIV-positive). In recent years, the emergence of multi-drug resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB has increased pressure to urgently control the disease and epidemic, particularly in countries with a high rate of HIV. As a result of years of inadequate diagnosis and treatment, these types of drug-resistant TB are more difficult and costly to treat, highlighting the urgent need for new, better, faster-acting treatments.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Launched in August 2012, TB Drug Accelerator (TBDA) is a ground-breaking partnership between eight pharmaceutical companies and seven research organizations with support from the Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation.
Aided by nearly U.S. $20 million (approx. €16.5 million) from the Gates Foundation, the TBDA aims to develop five new pre-clinical drug candidates with treatment-shortening potential within five years and proof-of-concept for a one-month three-drug regimen within ten years. TBDA targets the discovery of new TB drugs by collaborating on early-stage research. The long-term goal of the TBDA is to create a TB drug regimen that cures patients in only one month, rather than the 6 months now needed for treatment.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Tuberculosis (TB), often thought of as a disease of the past, continues to plague the world’s most vulnerable populations. A curable disease, it claims the lives of 1.4 million people each year, according to the WHO. Ninety-eight (98) percent of these deaths occur in the developing world, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development. More than 2 billion people, or roughly one-third of the world’s population, are infected with the microbes that cause TB. Of those infected, one in 10 will become sick with active TB.
The most popular vaccine used to treat TB was developed in the early 20th century using a bovine strain of the disease. Despite widespread use, the vaccine does not always work. It has been shown to protect against severe TB in children, but there is little evidence of effectiveness in adults. Furthermore, it can create a false-positive TB test in those who have been vaccinated.
To cure TB requires a regimen of several medicines that must be taken daily for six to nine months. But many patients fail to complete the treatment, or medication is incorrectly prescribed, which can lead to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The battle against TB requires new, faster-acting medicines at affordable prices. The Lilly TB Drug Discovery Initiative, launched in June 2007, is a nonprofit public/private partnership focused on accelerating early-stage TB drug discovery. The initiative is run from a research facility in Seattle, Washington, and operates in partnership with the Infectious Disease Research Institute, MSD, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Bringing together specialists from around the world for the systematic exploration of vast, private molecular libraries, the initiative has a primary goal of filling the pipeline with new clinical candidates for future TB drug development.
Lilly donated USD 15 million to launch the effort and has opened our library of more than 500,000 existing molecular compounds to test for possible TB treatments, including more effective treatments for drug-resistant strains. In 2008, the initiative announced its first acquisition of compounds for further development into drug candidates.
In November 2011, Lilly announced that it is providing more than USD 4 million in additional funding to the Infectious Disease Research Institute. The funding will allow IDRI to continue its early phase drug discovery efforts focused on identifying new and better therapies in the fight against tuberculosis, including multi-drug resistant strains known as MDR-TB. In addition, Lilly will provide more than USD 1 million in-kind for volunteer time from Lilly scientists and access to the company's drug discovery expertise, chemical libraries, and research tools.
These additional commitments bring Lilly's total support of early stage TB drug discovery efforts through IDRI to more than USD 20 million — and Lilly's total funding of TB and MDR-TB efforts to more than USD 170 million.
IDRI is a member of the Lilly TB Drug Discovery Initiative, a not-for-profit public-private partnership focused on accelerating early stage drug discovery for potential new treatments for TB. TB and MDR-TB disproportionately affect people in countries with developing economies.
Tackling MDR-TB has proven challenging. Less than one percent of estimated MDR-TB patients globally receive appropriate treatment. Over the past eight years, Lilly has learned a lot about the myriad obstacles blocking patient access to diagnosis and treatment. The strategy of transferring technology has proved especially timely, as we realize now that the need for medicines is much greater than anyone imagined when we first began.
Removing barriers will take a focused, coordinated effort by everyone committed to stamping out TB. Success depends on a sustained, joint commitment by governments, NGOs, and businesses to bring an end to this disease.

Additionally, in 2011, Lilly announced the launch of a new open innovation platform designed to help build the company's pipeline of tomorrow and, from a philanthropic perspective, identify molecules that may have application for treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The new platform, titled Open Innovation Drug Discovery, is supported by an innovative new website available at openinnovation.Lilly.com. It builds on the success of Lilly's Phenotypic Drug Discovery Initiative (PD2) that was launched in 2009 to facilitate research on molecules around the world that have the potential to ultimately be developed into medicines.
In addition to focusing on research areas in which Lilly has an internal strategic focus and deep expertise—cancer, endocrine, cardiovascular and neuroscience—the open innovation platform now will serve as a bridge between external scientists and the not-for-profit Lilly TB Drug Discovery Initiative, whose mission is to accelerate early-stage drug discovery and help identify the TB medicines of the future.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Tanzania is a high-burden country with about 60,000 new TB cases annually. TB is very complex to treat, requiring a combination of daily drugs over a half-year treatment period. To avoid resistances over the long treatment period, the WHO recommends Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS), requiring patients to take their drugs under daily observation of a healthcare professional. Although DOTS ensures better patient adherence, it burdens both providers and patients. Already overstretched healthcare personnel face an increased workload, and patients often have to walk long distances every day to receive their medication.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Since 2005, Novartis has donated gold standard TB medicines for the treatment of all adult patients in Tanzania. The medicines are given to the Global Drug Facility (GDF) of the Stop TB Partnership which is part of the WHO. The fixed-dose combination therapy shortens the treatment period from 8 to 6 months. Novartis also funds logistics and independent quality control. Drug donations do not guarantee, access and adherence to TB treatment, so the Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development, in collaboration with the National TB and Leprosy Program of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has taken DOTS one step further in Tanzania. Patient-centered TB treatment gives patients the choice to follow treatment either at a health facility or at home supervised by a family or community member. PCT still adheres to DOTS but the approach avoids daily traveling for patients and helps relieve overburdened health workers.
Preventing resistances is one of the major challenges of treating TB. Healthcare staff and treatment supporters must make sure patients adhere to the daily medicine intake. To further improve knowledge about TB and PCT, the Novartis Foundation produced a training video in 2011 that gives a step-by-step explanation of PCT. The video is currently being rolled out across Tanzania, and its effectiveness in both in-service and pre-service is being evaluated.
Lessons learned
The PCT project demonstrated that the majority of patients prefer the home-based treatment option, and adherence remains high (95%). A treatment supporter in the same household is more effective in improving adherence then a treatment supporter more than 15 minutes walking away. 
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
From 2005 to 2008 Novartis donated nearly 250,000 rifampicin-based fixed-dose combination tablets for the treatment of TB in Tanzania. Another 250,000 treatments were delivered between 2009 and 2012.
A survey revealed that 88% of TB patients chose home-based treatment, indicating the huge demand for the new treatment option. A recent study indicated that 95% of patients being treated at home adhered correctly to the medication. Home-based treatment does not, therefore, lead to a lower adherence rate compared to health facility-based treatment.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Epilepsy is a brain disorder that makes people more prone to seizures. 70 million people worldwide live with epilepsy but only 10 million people have access to adequate care. This means 90% of persons living with epilepsy in low-and middle-income countries have no access to care.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
UCB offers education, treatment and diagnosis to those in Congo, Rwanda, Mozambique, Myanmar and China. By improving community awareness on epilepsy, stigma can be addressed and those living with epilepsy can be better integrated into their communities.
In the DR Congo UCB works with the NGO Brothers of Charity in Lubumbashi to offer access to care for those living with epilepsy at the center and through the use of mobile clinics.
In Rwanda UCB supports initiatives that educate patients, communities and healthcare workers to bring access to diagnosis and treatment, supported by the government. A disease awareness campaign put in place by the Rwandan Organisation against Epilepsy and the Rwandan Biomedical Center resulted in the training of grass-root community health agents.  A total of 3,444 health agents attended the training courses.
In Mozambique the epilepsy initiative covered 16 health districts in five provinces, reaching a population of 3.4 million. Over 3400 persons living with epilepsy have been identified and benefit from this initiative. 
1,772 people have received training so far in Myanamar, providing the possibilty to reach out and educate others with the knowledge they have gained. Furthermore, 103,962 people participated in epilepsy awareness campaigns. These efforts reduce stigma and improve integration.
In 2016, 342 pediatricians completed a course in pediatric neurology organised by the Rainbow Bridge initiative. To date, the program trained physicians from 28 provinces. A Pediatric Epilepsy Primary Care Training Manual was developed and an on-line training manual is now available on the 24-hours medical broadcasting platform. Educational resources were also created and distributed in participating hospitals. Furthermore, a three minute video “Lolo, living with epilepsy” aimed to reduce the disease stigma, especially important for children, was shown in the hospitals and on eight media platform. In addition, 651 school teacher also received training on how to handle epileptic seizures and support children living with epilepsy. 
In 2016, two village doctors' training programs were organised in the “Health and Hope Fund” initiative with the Business Development Center of the Red Cross Society of China. 196 village doctors from hard-to-reach remote areas from Yunnan and inner-Mongolia attended a 15-day theoretical and practical courses.

Studies indicate an increasing number of individuals living with mental disorders each year. Usually, these people are excluded from the labor force. Experience in this area has shown that occupational activities can contribute to helping these patients rehabilitate and successfully re-join the labor market.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Tear Project is an initiative aimed to promote rehabilitation, reintegration into the workforce and increased independence and self-esteem for patients with mental disorders, by means of arts and labor qualification workshops. The beneficiaries are low-income individuals  living with schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, among other clinically stabilized mental disorders, selected from SUS – Unified Health System records in the city of Guarulhos. When they are selected to participate of the project by the psychosocial healthcare network as an innovative way to keep them healthy as recommended by the reformed Brazilian psychiatry, the individuals choose one of the workshops available and start to experience working under a cooperation model. The project focuses on specific goals, including:
Daily care through therapeutic-occupational workshops;
Diverse activities that promote strong interpersonal relationships;
Personal networking and support for families of these patients.
Fundraising activities.

Lessons learned
Pfizer actively contributes in order to make each country and community in which it operates a better place to live and work. In Brazil Pfizer has elected health education as the focus of its action in social projects, recognizing its talent and making available its experience and ability for enhancing people’s quality of life.

Summary of impact and forward looking information
The number of beneficiaries in the program has increased by 20% over the life of the program. The program has expanded its facilities, workshops and tools, developed a new website, multimedia room and library with books specifically addressing income generating activities. In 2015 the Tear Project offered nine occupational workshops and helped patients’ market products they have produced in income generating activities at fairs and events. It also operates a shop to sell these goods.

            What are teh health needs and challeneges?
Although access to first line treatments has improved in developing countries, due to the nature of the HIV virus which can replicate and mutate rapidly, the importance of second line treatments is growing. As a result, increasing manufacturing knowledge and capacity within these regions will play a vital role in providing access to these important therapies.
Summary of partnership activities and how they meet needs and challeneges
Roche initiated the AIDS Technology Transfer Initiative (TTI) aimed at sharing knowledge and supporting local companies in developing countries in gaining the skills needed to manufacture generic versions of vital HIV medicines.
A dedicated team from Roche shared knowledge and hands-on guidance and training on-site for the manufacture of the second line treatment, saquinavir, by local manufacturers in eligible countries. In addition to visiting their local production facilities, training was held at Roche’s factory in Spain to ensure key expertise was shared effectively.
Roche expanded its program in 2008 to include training seminars for local manufacturers across sub-Saharan Africa that focused on the development of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to improve locally-produced essential medicines - not just ARVs.
The goal of the four year program was to provide a sustainable solution to deliver HIV healthcare in resource-limited settings and to reduce African manufacturers’ reliance on the West.
Roche reviewed requests from manufacturers on a case-by-case basis and worked with companies that had the manufacturing capacity and capability to reach the right levels of quality and efficacy.
Lessons learned
During a survey performed in January 2012 it was identified that to date none of the 13 manufacturers/organizations had commenced routine production of saquinivir. This was primarily due to low demand for the product as changing treatment regimens and guidelines position saquinivir further down the list of preferred medications. Due to this, the price of API remains high and generic manufacturers lack sufficient return on high initial investment costs. However, all of the companies now have the capabilities to produce generic medicines under GMP conditions.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and looking forward  
During the initiative, Roche received expressions of interest from 41 manufacturers in 17 countries, assessed 39 of them to determine timing and delivery of technical expertise, and finalised agreements with 13 companies and organizations in 6 countries. These companies and organizations are now capable of producing generic copies of saquinavir.Additionally, through the training seminars, around 60 delegates from 20 organizations were trained on compliance to GMP.

Quantify and understand the impact of cancer on household economic wellbeing, and patient survival and quality of life in countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Provide a body of evidence on which countries in the region can base decisions about how to address the burden of cost of illness, and improve access to cancer care.

            What are the health needs and challenges? 
More than 75% of people with cancer in Southeast Asian countries experience death or financial catastrophe within a year of diagnosis. Treatments are costly and the disease significantly impairs people’s ability to work, resulting in economic hardship that can, in turn, have a devastating impact on cancer outcomes. 
But cancer care is not a high priority in ASEAN countries, and only a few governments identify cancer as an impediment to economic growth. With little evidence available to articulate the economic impact of cancer on low and middle income households, and its relationship to treatment and health outcomes, a profound lack of understanding surrounds the burden of the disease. 
And yet it is a burden that is growing. It is estimated that there were over 770,000 new cases of cancer and 527,000 cancer deaths in the region in 2012. The number of new cases is expected to rise by around 70% by 2030, to reach 1.3 million.
Roche wanted to quantify the true cost of cancer, and improve understanding of its impact. Providing evidence would be a crucial step in supporting countries in the region to identify where investment can be targeted most effectively to reduce the burden the disease represents.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The ACTION study (Asean CosTs In Oncology) was the largest study ever conducted in the region. Led by the George Institute for Global Health and supported by Roche, it was the first of its kind to examine the human cost of cancer to populations across eight countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
The study was designed to assess the impact of cancer on household economic wellbeing, as well as patient survival and quality of life. It would also provide evidence to help countries in the region make decisions that would improve access to cancer care and provide adequate financial protection from the burden of costs associated with the illness.
The longitudinal cohort study followed 9,513 cancer patients through their first year following diagnosis. It represented a broad, partly working-age population with a mean age of 52 years, and involved a mix of public and private hospitals.
Key activities were planned around the publication of the report’s findings in August 2015. These included a keynote presentation at a regional conference, roundtables with senior health advisors from the ASEAN countries, and patient association events. All eight countries were represented at every event.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The data generated by the ACTION study improved understanding of the challenges faced by cancer patients in Southeast Asia, and provided a factual basis for decisions around cancer services by policy-makers in the region.
In Malaysia, patient organisation Together Against Cancer (TAC), used the study results to appeal for cancer drugs to receive an exemption from Goods and Services Tax (GST). Their efforts were successful. There was also a 33% increase in allocation for radiotherapy and oncology services.
In Indonesia, local evidence was instrumental to the creation of new cancer treatment guidelines. Moreover, a large stakeholder forum highlighting the ACTION study contributed to had a positive impact on reimbursement decisions for Herceptin and other cancer drugs in 2016.
Similar initiatives are now underway in the Middle East and LATAM regions, in collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and The Economist Intelligence Unit respectively.
Measurement of progress towards objectives 
The ACTION study provided a rigorous, scientific and detailed assessment of the impact of cancer on patients in Southeast Asia. Offering the first evidence of its kind to quantify the burden of cost the illness can represent, the study proved to be a vital tool for health advisors and policy makers

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of 17 diseases that disproportionally impact those living in poverty. More than 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by NTDs, including more than 500 million children. The opportunity exists to help millions of people avoid significant debilitation and disability, including malnutrition, disfigurement and social discrimination.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Many NTDs can be controlled through existing, affordable interventions and tremendous progress has been made in recent years.
Consistent with the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (January 2012), the public and private partners will seek by 2020 to help eradicate Guinea worm disease, help eliminate lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), leprosy, sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis) and blinding trachoma and river blindness (in Latin America, Yemen and selected countries in Africa), and help control schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthes, Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) and visceral leishmaniasis.
To achieve this, original endorsers of the London Declaration, including twelve pharmaceutical companies, the World Health Organization, governments of the United States and United Kingdom, Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank, among others, work cooperatively to sustain or expand existing drug donation programs to meet demand through 2020. These partners share their expertise and compounds to accelerate research and development of new drugs and provide more than USD 785 million to support R&D efforts and strengthen drug distribution and implementation programs.
The partners also seek to advance R&D for many of these diseases through partnerships and by providing funding to find next-generation treatments and interventions for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). They enhance collaboration and coordination on NTDs at national and international levels through public and private multilateral organizations to work more efficiently and effectively together. Partners ensure endemic countries have the funding necessary to implement NTD programs that will help achieve these goals, supported by strong and committed health systems at the national level.
These are the five big commitments made in the London Declaration:
Sustain, expand and extend programs that ensure the necessary supply of drugs and other interventions to help eradicate some diseases and to help control others by 2020.
Advance R&D through partnerships and provision of funding to find next-generation treatments and interventions for neglected diseases.
Enhance collaboration and coordination on NTDs at national and international levels through public and private multilateral organizations.
Enable adequate funding with endemic countries to implement NTD programs necessary to achieve these goals, supported by strong and committed health systems at the national level.
Provide technical support, tools and resources to support NTD-endemic countries to evaluate and monitor programs.
By providing access to existing drugs and accelerating development of new treatments, millions of people can have a better opportunity to succeed in school and lead a more socially and economically productive lives.
The partners provide regular updates about their progress in reaching the 2020 goals and identify remaining gaps.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2015, pharmaceutical companies donated an estimated 2.4 billion tablets, enough for 1.5 billion treatments to prevent and treat NTDs – an increase of 11.7% from 2014. An unprecedented 1.1 billion treatments were delivered to 858 million individuals in 2014. Between 2012 and 2014, the number of people who needed treatment decreased by 230 million. Since the London Declaration, there have been over 7.9 billion tablets in pharma donations, which is enough for 5 billion treatments.
Thus, one of the largest public health programs in the world owes its success to a drug donation program on a truly global scale. The generous contributions of pharmaceutical partners ensure that preventive chemotherapy programs for NTDs are highly cost-effective, ranking them as one of the best buys in global development.
Furthermore, the number of people who needed treatment for lymphatic filariasis (LF) decreased by 230 million between 2012 and 2014. Thanks to the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP) there have been examinations of over 2.6 million people in 29 countries, representing a total of 224 million people. 18 of 73 countries endemic for LF and 8 of 58 countries endemic for trachoma have stopped mass drug administration (MDA) and are under post-MDA surveillance; an additional 22 countries are on track to achieve elimination of LF as a public health problem by 2020. Four of six endemic countries in the Americas have met the 2015 target of elimination of onchocerciasis, the disease remaining only in hard-to-reach Yanomami communities on the border between Brazil and Venezuela. The program in Africa is the only program to successfully achieve its coverage target.
Merck doubled its donation from 100 million tablets in 2015 to 200 million in 2016. To date, more than 100 million patients have been treated, consisting primarily of children. Merck and Astellas are part of a public-private partnership to help develop an effective pediatric formulation of praziquantel to treat children under six years old, an age group which accounts for around 10% of the global population infected or at risk for schistosomiasis.
Through participation in the London Declaration Bristol-Myers Squibb extended the reach of its R&D efforts into NTDs, providing access to proprietary compound libraries to third parties, including Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), to help develop potential new medicines for targeted NTDs. BMS further extended its collaboration with DNDi on Chagas and Leishmaniasis and to identify potential clinical stage compounds with activity against helminthes. Furthermore, at the Institut Pasteur Korea, thousands of compounds from the Bristol-Myers Squibb library were screened and over 100 compounds were identified with potential activity against Chagas Disease and Visceral Leishmaniasis. Initial screening at the University of Dundee identified 119 compounds with potential activity against Visceral Leishmaniasis.
In 2014 Bayer and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) started a product development partnership on the active ingredient emodepside to develop a new oral drug to treat river blindness. Emodepside originates from the Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas and has been developed by Bayer’s Animal Health division for veterinary use. The compound has been found to be effective in killing adult worms in pre-clinical studies, thus showing potential as a new ‘macrofilaricidal’ drug for the treatment of patients with river blindness. A current Bayer study  on the compound nifurtimox is to develop an appropriate, weight-adjusted dosing for newborn babies and children. The study, which involves pediatric patients including newborn babies, also aims to provide evidence for a shorter treatment duration. 
Sanofi contributes to the fight against neglected tropical diseases, particularly within the scope of a long-term partnership with the WHO. Launched in 2001 with a program focused on sleeping sickness, their partnership was extended to include Leishmaniasis, Buruli ulcer, yaws and Chagas disease. Since then, over 27 million people living in endemic areas in sub-Saharna Africa have been screened for sleeping sickness, and more than 175,000 people have received free treatment.  In partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), Sanofi is working to develop a new oral treatment and Novartis is engaged in drug discovery to identify improved oral treatment that could support disease elimination efforts.
Bayer develops a new formulation of nifurtimox to allow weight-adjusted doses in children of all age groups suffering from Chagas disease. The study in pediatric patients including newborn babies also aims to provide evidence for shorter treatment duration.
Donated drugs from Pharma companies are essential to achieving the goals of control and elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson founded the NTD Supply Chain Forum (NTDSCF) in October 2012 with the goal of identifying and addressing impediments to NTD drug delivery. The Forum’s over-arching purpose is to streamline and coordinate the provision of donated drugs/supplies for country NTD programs. It is an excellent example of collaboration between companies, the WHO and the Gates Foundation in support of commitments made as part of the London Declaration.
The NTDSCF was initiated by a coalition of NTD drug supply chain partners led by GSK, and currently includes Eisai, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, MSD*, Merck, Sanofi, WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as freight forwarder DHL and supporting NGOs (Children Without Worms, International Trachoma Initiative, Mectizan Donation Program and RTI International).
The Forum initially focused on delivery of NTD drugs from the manufacturer to the endemic countries (the ‘First Mile’) primarily focused on the preventative chemotherapy diseases that rely on MDA where drugs are frequently co-administered. More recently, it expanded its remit to assess possible in-country supply chain management and distribution areas where further support may be required (the ‘Last Mile’).

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced. It kills nearly six million people a year. Approximately one person dies every six seconds due to tobacco and this accounts for one in 10 adult deaths. Up to half of current users will eventually die of a tobacco-related disease.
Among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most want to quit. Counselling and medication can more than double the chance that a smoker who tries to quit will succeed. National comprehensive health-care services supporting cessation are available in only 19 countries, representing 14% of the world's population. There is no cessation assistance in 28% of low-income countries and 7% of middle-income countries. Mass media campaigns can also reduce tobacco consumption, by influencing people to protect non-smokers and convincing youths to stop using tobacco.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
For 15-25 year olds to learn for themselves about the effects and impact of smoking and to adopt healthy behaviours, via a high quality training programme and activities.
Through the use of participatory training sessions and social media communications designed to appeal to 15-25 year olds, the goal is to help them to learn for themselves about the effects and impact of  smoking and to adopt healthy behaviours. Because people are most likely to begin to use tobacco as adolescents, it is especially important to inform young people about the harms of tobacco use before they start. Health warnings can be conveyed using many different methods, including warning labels on tobacco packaging and anti-tobacco mass media campaigns.
This project complements Turkish MoH’s smoking cessation campaign, targetting 13,500 young people through the use of a wide range of communications tools and education training sessions. 
A pool of young people has been recruited from within the TOG network of schools and universities to act as ambassadors and peer educators for the anti-tobacco campaign. This approach follows the aim of positioning youth as spokespersons for an anti-tobacco campaign, the social media campaign will also encourage young people to become anti-tobacco bloggers.
Research shows that anti-smoking information should be prepared and presented in ways that address the needs of young people, and the reasons they smoke, rather than to persuade by attempts to scare.
Lessons learned          
Reducing the prevalence of tobacco use cannot be made without strong political will and governmental commitment to adopt and implement robust tobacco control policies.
In this work, countries have a powerful tool in the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In 2005, Turkey became a Party to the Convention, and in 2009 Turkey became the third country in Europe to go 100 per cent smoke free, following the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Proven measures to reduce tobacco use include mandatory health warning labels on tobacco packaging and hard-hitting mass media campaigns that show the harms of tobacco use. Correspondingly, the Ministry of Health’s anti-tobacco campaign was published on TV, via the internet, and on print ads warning people of the dangers of cigarettes by emphasizing the suffering that smoking causes. A call center, “ALO 171,” was also started to help people quit smoking.
Broad educational efforts that reach all age groups are considered more effective in influencing youth behaviour than efforts targeted specifically at them from an adult perspective, hence the adoption of the peer educators’ approach of learning via participatory workshops that are fun and relevant to young adults.  
Summary of impact and forward looking information
By end of 2014 6 cities in Turkey will have signed up to the programme and 120 volunteers hired to develop the training and communications materials for widespread dissemination.  1800 young adults are expected to be reached via the workshops in 2014.
Tobacco Free Youth Week Activities are expected in 20 cities.
By end 2015 it is expected 8 cities will have signed up to the programme and 160 volunteers hired.  2400 young adults are expected to be reached via the workshops in 2015. 
Communications tools include the development of an anti-tobacco youth video, specifically aimed at young people and estimated to reach 3,000.  A social media campaign, initiated through Twitter, is expected to reach 20,000 and will be further promulgated by young people being encouraged to become anti-tobacco bloggers themselves. The first-ever youth-led anti-tobacco week of activities, aligned to the WHO World No-Tobacco Day on 31st May, will be led by 20 TOG teams reaching 6,000 young people and is expected to attract wide media attention.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Diabetes is a global epidemic that carries with it a particularly set of complex challenges. Changing lifestyles, low levels of disease awareness and prevention education and poor access to treatment are contributing to the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in China and India, the world’s two most populous nations.
The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) reports that more than 109 million people in China had diabetes in 2015, the most of any country. That figure is projected to grow to 129.7 million, or 12.1 percent of the population, by 2030. China alone had 1.3 million deaths due to diabetes in 2015.
India, which has 61.26 million people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (8.3 percent of the population), ranks second only to China in total cases and third behind the United States (10.9 percent) and China in terms of prevalence. By 2030, India will have 101.2 million people with type 2 diabetes, IDF projects.
Millions of more people are undiagnosed. In fact, the International Diabetes Federation estimates that globally as many as half of the people living with diabetes are unaware of their condition. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Together on Diabetes™ is the flagship philanthropic program of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation. In China, BMS is working with several foundations to reach out to patients, health care providers and to reduce the socio-economic burden of diabetes management for families and public health facilities. For instance, BMS Foundation is working with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on a project to enhance the capacity of rural health care providers to manage and prevent type 2 diabetes at the village level in Western China, where diabetes is growing at a faster rate than in China’s cities. Efforts focus on identifying high-risk rural populations and ensuring timely interventions to prevent disease onset. These interventions include health care provider training, disease screenings and patient education. The Chinese CDC is also mobilizing government and community leaders to prioritize diabetes disease management.
In India, BMS partners with local actors such as the MAMTA Health Institute for Mother and Child to increase the skills of community health volunteers to provide diabetes risk-management education and family counselling for non-communicable diseases. The project also links patients to health care providers in order to promote healthy lifestyles, early detection and healthy behaviors.

            Comprehensive action for metabolic health and wellbeing - Integration of a Diabetes intervention with a liver health program
Partnership objectives
1. Planning and Implementation of an integrated intervention to improve awareness, increased early diagnosis leading to improved care, in diabetes and liver disease as a comprehensive metabolic package.
2. Creation of a health care workforce that forms the nidus of such intervention and can serve as a model to be replicated in subsequent national public sector initiative – if found useful.
3. To carry out operational research in the interface of diabetes and liver diseases – that can serve as a template for planning future interventions in the community as well as clinic based care.
4. Development of an overall scientific and perceptual environment that facilitate action and care in metabolic diseases as an integrated entity.
Overall the aim of this research project is the assessment of the prevalence of diabetes in the rural area, promotion of metabolic health and assessment of liver disease in relation to diabetes.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
The frequency of liver disease in diabetics is high. NAFLD, of varying stage, is present in nearly one-third of diabetics and more so, when obese. NAFLD contributes to morbidity of diabetics, increases the need for clinical care and hospitalizations and predisposes diabetics to the development of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and strokes. Apart from NAFLD, prevalence of Hepatitis C amongst diabetics is also higher than amongst non-diabetics. Outcome of liver disease worsens with diabetes and diabetes is a factor for faster progression of liver disease of any etiology, including adversely influences on treatment outcomes in Hepatitis C. Diabetics also develop Hepatocellular carcinoma more frequently than non-diabetics. All these highlight the need for tight diabetic control and an integrated approach targeting metabolic homeostasis in diabetes patients.
In the light of the above, development of a “metabolic health port” that acts, fosters and disseminates necessary information seems to be a viable and sustainable initiative for a concerted action in metabolic health.
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contribute nearly half of all deaths in India and significant morbidity and disability. Prevalence of NCDs is also increasing in rural India. As ‘the risk factors of today are the diseases of tomorrow’, therefore identification of such factors and periodical assessment are very important to prevent NCDs at the present time.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The project envisages the following components:
An awareness and action component
Central of which is the creation of “metabolic ports” that provide integrated function in metabolic diseases namely – diabetes, liver disease and hypertension.
The projects implement community level awareness and screening for diabetes, blood pressure and liver disease – as critical, interrelated metabolic health determinants. Each port is staffed with trained rural health care providers (RHCP) (in rural areas) and by other category of health providers – suitably trained - in urban areas.  Since the vast majority of people live in rural areas, the primary focus is the rural habitations. Each peripheral metabolic is equipped with a glucometer, blood pressure equipment, a weighing machine and informative tools for awareness generation. We have screened 125,000 individuals by November 2016. 
An operational research component
1. An appraisal of the “perception” of people and providers guides this intervention as a flagship: This first part is to have an appraisal of the existing perception, knowledge and practice amongst the people as well as the providers of different category – both formal and informal – regarding the metabolic diseases, focusing on diabetes and liver disease.
2. A clinic based multi centric research is undertaken to investigate the intricate relationship between diabetes and liver disease. The aims of this research are to capture the ways that diabetes and liver disease interfere in each other’s natural history, in the short term.
Two groups of patients will be included in the documentation and short term follow up study:
Patients with Chronic Viral liver Diseases and diabetes.
Patients with Chronic Viral Liver Diseases and no diabetes.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
 1. Increased awareness amongst people in metabolic health as an integrated platform.
2. Improved detection of diabetes, hypertension and abnormal liver tests amongst asymptomatic people – who otherwise would have gone undetected /detected late in the course of life. This would create a permissive motivational situation for the need of intervention in “asymptomatic metabolic ill health” at the individual and community level.
3. Encouraging behaviour change to embrace a habit for regular monitoring in management of diabetes and hypertension in individuals as well as in the overall culture of the society.
4. Non pharmacological modalities in lifestyle diseases such as exercising, healthy cooking and eating is encouriaged.
5. Better possibility of integration of the RHCPs and strengthening their role as an enriched clan of health worker in the mainstream health care delivery system.
6. Better understanding of the level of awareness amongst people and providers – finding out the key areas warranting attention in intervention.
7. The “liver – diabetes interface” research will bring forth the critical operational issues in planning management of diabetes in liver disease – a common and evolving problem.

Since 2008, Boehringer Ingelheim supports the training of pharmaceutical/medical-technical assistants at the École Polyvalente Carolus Magnus (EPCM) in the capital of Burundi, Bujumbura. A specific four year training enables students to pass the A2 diploma for pharmaceutical/medical-technical assistants. For practical training within this program, the school is equipped with several laboratories.
The diploma is officially acknowledged by the Burundi government and qualifies students for higher education in connection with a governmental A-level exam. All teachers and trainers at EPCM are locals — those in the pharmaceutical/medical technical section were trained in GMP seminars, and those in chemistry trained through an internship at a BI production plant in Ingelheim in 2013.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The school operates with great success: nearly all EPCM students found employment in Burundi after graduation from the school. Due to its popularity, an expansion for around 500 places is planned.
The second part of the project will involve the setup of a local production plant (‘Burundipharm’) in terms of a social enterprise in order to secure availability of essential medicines in the country. This will also provide additional opportunities for employment of EPCM graduates.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Chagas (American trypanosomiasis) is a tropical disease that exists only in South America, affecting around 18 million people. In Brazil alone, 5 to 6 million people suffer from Chagas. The disease is caused by trypanosoma, a blood and cell parasite that is transmitted by an insect vector, and is potentially lethal. Chagas was identified by the World Health Organization as one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases needing eradication or elimination.
Benzonidazole is the most effective drug used to treat Chagas, a fact that has been recognized by the Pan-American Health Organization and the World Health Organization.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
To assist Brazil’s efforts to reduce the impact of Chagas disease, Roche donated the rights, trade data and knowledge and technical information to manufacture its medicine Benzonidazole to the Brazilian government. The technical transfer was completed in 2008.
Following Roche’s donation, the Brazilian government set up a manufacturing plant in the state of Acre in the Amazon region and started producing the finished drug with the know-how supplied by Roche. The organization manufacturing Benzonidazole is now known as the State Pharmaceutical Laboratory of Pernambuco (LAFEPE). Nortec Quimica is producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient. LAFEPE has received pre-qualification to export the medicine to comply with worldwide demand. The product is exported by an international distributor upon request.
With local manufacturing capabilities, the Brazilian Government can optimize the production and use of Benzonidazole within its current programs.

Lymphatic Filariasis (or elephantiasis) is a parasitic disease that is transmitted to humans by a mosquito bite. Once transmitted, it causes lymphatic dysfunction that leads to other serious physical disabilities such as elephantiasis. Currently, the disease affects an estimated 120 million people in 73 countries worldwide, mostly in developing and emerging nations in Africa and Southeast Asia.
Lymphatic Filariasis can be treated with a combination of two anti-parasitic agents, including diethycarbamazine (DEC). Large-scale interventions, in which all inhabitants of endemic areas are administered DEC once a year for at least five years, are required to eliminate the disease.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2012 Eisai and Sanofi announced a new partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to join the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis by 2020. These commitments are a key part of the ""Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases"" partnership.
Eisai began manufacturing and supplying 2.2 billion tablets of DEC to WHO in October 2013. To ensure a stable of supply of DEC until the Eisai-produced DEC became available, Eisai, Sanofi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed to provide 120 million DEC tablets manufactured by Sanofi to the WHO free of charge. This was the first partnership in which two pharmaceutical companies, with the Gates Foundation, came together to supply a single drug for an NTD.
Summary of impact through December 2013 and forward looking information
Sixty million tablets of Diethylcarbamazine 100mg base, were delivered to the WHO in 2012, and 60 million were delivered in 2013. The progress of the Eisai-Sanofi-WHO initiative on Lymphatic Filariasis is monitored through the United to Combat NTDs ""London Declaration"" Annual Scorecard; latest version released in January 2013.

            Partnership Objectives
Provide general healthcare, disease awareness, health education and counseling in rural areas of South Africa.
Help train local student doctors and nurses.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
In rural communities in resource-limited countries where there is usually a very poor doctor-to-patient ratio, people travel long distances to receive even basic healthcare provision. The Transnet-Phelophepa train aims to address this challenge by travelling to up to 70 remote communities per year to bring healthcare services directly to the patients.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Transnet-Phelophepa is a free, mobile healthcare clinic that travels to areas of rural South Africa, where there is just one doctor for every 5,000 patients. Phelophepa is owned and operated by Transnet Foundation with Roche being Phelophepa’s main external sponsor, providing funding since the train took its first journey in 1994.
There are two trains (Phelophepa I and Phelophepa II), each comprised of 18 coaches providing facilities to conduct general health, dental and eye checks in rural communities, and dispense treatments for diagnosed conditions. In addition to these general health services, individual counselling sessions and group workshops to help people cope with psychological issues such as stress and depression are offered.
The trains also house special coaches for education, where members of the local communities can participate in classes on general health issues such as nutrition, hygiene and dental health. More specialist services have been introduced, including diabetes prevention, hypertension and cancer screening, with free pap smears and prostate screening now being provided in a tent set up on the train’s platform at some stops.
The result of the broad reach of Phelophepa is better awareness of common health issues within these remote and often poorly educated communities. There is an increased likelihood of people presenting for examination, and consequently more chance that patients can receive appropriate treatment. Ultimately the outcomes of Phelophepa are driven by the focus on ‘good, clean health’. Health inspires productivity, productivity generates growth and growth inspires prosperity.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
Since the first train started its journey more than 20 years ago, the trains have touched the lives of approximately 12 million people, dispensed more than half a million pairs of spectacles and provided medication to over 650,000 people. Since the trains’ inception, more than 15,000 volunteers have participated in a basic healthcare education programme, and over three million people have participated in HIV/AIDS and first aid training. On average, the Phelophepa I and Phelophepa II trains reach more than 375,000 people a year and serves as a training opportunity for student doctors and nurses and job opportunity for hundreds of unemployed or retired health professionals.

Measles remains an important cause of childhood mortality, especially in developing countries. Launched in 2001, the Measles Initiative is a partnership — led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and World Health Organization — committed to reducing measles deaths worldwide.
The Measles Initiative founding partners provide technical and financial support to governments and communities conducting mass vaccination campaigns, improving routine immunization services, and establishing effective disease surveillance. To date, the partnership has invested USD 670 million in measles control activities, helping to save an estimated 4.3 million lives.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In 2008, MSD supported the Measles Initiative with a USD 2 million grant to “Strengthen Surveillance across Sub-Sahara Africa”. This grant supported training activities, laboratory strengthening, and actual surveillance activities after completion of campaigns.
In 2011, MSD continued its support with an additional USD 250,000 grant to support campaigns that will vaccinate more than 27 million children against measles in Nigeria.
MSD also provided a USD 300,000 grant to strengthen measles surveillance and routine immunization efforts in India, thereby helping to support campaigns in 2012 that vaccinated more than 122 million children in India.
Summary of impact and forward looking information
The initiative is currently focused on supporting the United Nations’ goal of reducing global measles mortality by 90 percent (2000-2010). Initially targeting Sub-Saharan Africa, the Measles Initiative has helped reduce deaths by 92 percent across the region. Building on its success, the Measles Initiative now supports vaccination campaigns worldwide.
More than 1 billion children in more than 60 countries have received a measles vaccination as a result of the Initiative. Globally, deaths have decreased by 78 percent (between 2000 and 2008).

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Ethiopia is one of five countries that together account for 50% of maternal deaths worldwide. Despite considerable efforts, the maternal mortality rate of 470/100,000 live births is still unacceptable. Only 10% of Ethiopian women deliver their infants with a skilled professional, 51% of hospitals offer comprehensive obstetric and neonatal emergency and 14% of health centers deliver obstetric care and basic neonatal emergency care.
The situation is compounded by disparities between different areas of Oromiya, including Arsi which is among the most disadvantaged in terms of obstetric care coverage, particularly in remote locations.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
This project, supported by the Sanofi Espoir Foundation, is driven by the importance of acting globally. It aims to address the midwifery skills gap and improve the way midwives organize their work, including infrastructure, facilities and medical equipment, transport of patients, etc.
The main thrusts of this project are:
Capacity building by upskilling the 184 midwives practicing in the Arsi area.
Improving the conditions for delivering care by renovating and equipping health centers in the area.
Improving the supply of obstetric care through a better geographical distribution of midwives.
Networking midwives and other professionals involved in maternal health, in partnership with the Association of Ethiopian midwives, in order to provide training, improve collaboration and professional solidarity, facilitate the planning of replacements and the supply of medicines and emergency medical equipment.
Rolling out two smartphone or tablet applications - ""Partogram"" and ""Néonatogram"" - as a decision-aid tool to help midwives improve the management of deliveries and of maternal and neonatal complications.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Despite significant progress over the last decade, over 22 million children in developing nations remain without access to life-saving vaccines.
Most vaccines must be kept cold and transported under constant refrigeration via a so-called ‘cold chain’ which is a significant challenge in hot, remote and resource-limited regions. Reducing dependence on the cold chain is a key approach to support the effective and affordable delivery of vaccines for global health.
The health need and challenge is to make vaccines more resistant to heat, thus reducing the need for refrigeration. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The partnership look to conduct early stage research into vaccine thermostability to make vaccines more resistant to heat. This will reduce dependence on the cold chain, which is a key approach to support the effective and affordable delivery of vaccines for global health.
The project will focus initially on the adjuvant which is used in GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate, currently in late-stage development in partnership with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative. RTS,S has been designed for use in infants and children from sub-Saharan Africa, where maintaining vaccines at an optimum temperature can be challenging. Developing a method of making the adjuvant more heat stable could bring a significant public health benefit.
The results could also have broader applications for other vaccines containing this adjuvant, including vaccines in development by GSK against HIV and tuberculosis.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
It is a well-known fact Haiti’s health system lacks a well-defined, temperature-controlled, cold-chain system evidenced by our operations in the country since January 2010. The country’s lack of a country wide temperature-controlled cold-chain system, with no easily accessible, regional distributed, accessible or redundant locations, prevents and continues to inhibit the acquisition, acceptance of donations and distribution of millions of dollars of needed pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other environmentally controlled substances to support natural disasters and now pandemic cholera epidemics and other disease outbreaks. This known detriment adversely affects NGOs and government health operators across the country during attempts to critically resupply health facilities in time of emergent need. This grant proposal, regionally positioned in a northern strategic location, nearby a major seaport location, would help achieve such a strategic objective and have immediate and lasting impact on supporting NGOs and government systems working to strengthening Haiti’s health care system.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In partnership with GSK, Project HOPE has recently installed a cold chain facility at Hopital Sacre-Coeur de Milot, the only one of its kind in northern Haiti. The facility includes a refrigeration unit, compressor and other equipment needed to maintain a constant temperature between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. The cold chain ensures vaccine potency, quality and safety from the moment the vaccine is manufactured until the point it is administered to patients.

The Boehringer Ingelheim Botswana ""We Care"" Program, which includes the ""Wellness Days"" and the ""Heart Art Competition"", aims to educate the general public in Botswana, rather than healthcare professionals.
The Wellness Days seek to educate through a program of talks, blood pressure screening and counselling. Patients attend a ""Wellness Talk"" given by the Cardiac Clinic and the Boehringer Ingelheim staff to inform them about the dangers of high blood pressure, the importance of a healthy lifestyle, exercise and diet. By October 2009, 6,000 patients had been screened and informed.
The “Heart Art Competition” takes a series of lectures based on a healthy lifestyle exercise and diet to schools. Further contents of the lectures are high blood pressure, high blood sugar and obesity. For the competition, children do paintings depicting their understanding of the wellness message. The event was rolled out nationally in 2007, involving 86 schools.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Long-term chronic or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are one of the leading causes of premature deaths worldwide, accounting for approximately 60% of global deaths. Yet most NCDs are preventable by improving diet, increasing physical activity levels, stopping tobacco smoking and reducing harmful use of alcohol.
The global epidemic of NCDs is of major concern because it represents a significant threat to human health and development. Unless addressed, the burden of these diseases will continue to increase. All NCDs can either be prevented or, if identified early, treated and managed in a way that significantly reduces disability, financial and societal costs. The Health Improvement Card aims to improve global health through positive changes in behaviour and lifestyle and to reduce the 36 million a year burden from non-communicable diseases.
Description of partnership activities and how they address the needs and challenges
The scorecard helps individuals rate their behaviours on a “stoplight-type” fashion. Behaviours in red are labelled as highly risky. Behaviours in yellow indicate caution, and those in green correspond to healthy, sustainable behaviours. The goal is to help patients gradually move their behaviours to the green area. The NCD toolkit will be shared with over 26 million health care professionals in more than 130 countries to help encourage patients to identify and prevent risky behaviours.
The scorecard keeps track of biometrics and behaviours that affect a patient’s likelihood to develop a chronic illness over the long-term. Four biometric indicators and four lifestyle indicators provide a comprehensive panorama on the patient’s health status. A constant use of this resource allows individuals and health professionals to develop targeted interventions to improve their health and well-being.
The four biometrics help monitor:
Body mass index and cholesterol, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases
Fasting blood sugar, to help prevent diabetes
Blood pressure, to check for hypertension 
The four lifestyle indicators are shown to:
Avoid tobacco use and harmful alcohol consumption
Improve diet
Undertake regular sufficient physical activity
Achieve and maintain healthy weight
Manage tension and stress
Promote preventive care and screening for preventable illnesses 
Overall, the Health Improvement Card helps the health community pay due attention to the inextricable link between social determinants of health and the incidence of all NCDs—extending the scope to mental and oral health illnesses. By focusing on a holistic approach to health, WHPA goes beyond the narrow frame of corrective NCD action and promotes a sustainable change in behaviours to achieve health. WHPA hopes this initiative will strengthen the patient-doctor communication channels as well as primary healthcare systems. The scorecard reminds patients that health is in their hands.
A mobile application of the Health Improvement Card, called Healthy Score, is now available for download. The app includes an alert system based on the commitments selected to support people on their path to healither living.
