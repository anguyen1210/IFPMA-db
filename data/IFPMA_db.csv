            What are the health needs and challenges?
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, are the leading cause of death and illness worldwide. Success in the fight against infectious diseases, and rising living standards and the changes in lifestyle that accompany – unhealthy diet, tobacco use, and so on – have led to a rising proportion of global deaths accounted for by NCDs. Traditionally seen as diseases of high-income countries, low-income and emerging countries now account for nearly 50% of the global NCD burden. Four types of NCDs – cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases – kill 3 in 5 people in the world, with 80 per cent of these occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 
NCDs are a growing health and economic challenge for both rich and poor countries.
It is estimated, however, that half of the deaths caused by NCDs are preventable. Prevention can be achieved through increased health literacy, awareness and simple behavioral changes aimed at reducing common risk factors. 
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges:
Building on the IFRC’s long history of health promotion within communities by using simple tools adapted to local context, also known as the Community-based Health First Aid Manual (CBHFA), the IFRC-IFPMA '4 Healthy Habits' partnership develops and adds to the existing manual a module on healthy lifestyle guidelines and NCDs control and prevention.
In a bid to reduce risk factors from community members’ lifestyles, such as unhealthy diet, tobacco and physical inactivity, the module incorporates behavior change methods for different target groups (program managers, facilitators, volunteers and community members) to meet the needs of different age groups.
These tools are easy-to-use, interactive and available in three different languages. They are deployed for use by the 98 Red Cross Crescent National Societies worldwide and help Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers to empower their communities to do the required behavior changes for healthy lifestyle, focusing on the key necessary five steps: knowledge, approval, intention, practice and advocacy. Scoring tools are part of the guidelines to help the volunteers and community members to better understand their health status and get a targeted support. These scoring tools are available on paper-based, online and mHealth versions.
The IFRC will make the toolkit available to about 3 million people worldwide through a 15-million strong volunteer network in 189 countries. Volunteers in 20 countries in Asia and the Pacific and 13 countries in Europe, have already been trained and training is expected in a further 40 countries in the Americas and Africa by 2014. 
Lessons learned:
Fighting NCDs requires multi-stakeholders solutions. As a novel cross-sector collaboration responding to the United Nations call to tackle NCDs, the two-year partnership between the IFRC and IFPMA pools the expertise and resources of both partners in order to reach the highest impact possible at community level.
Summary of impact and forward looking information:
The 98 Red Cross Crescent National Societies are implementing community based health and first aid programs with over 30,000 active volunteers at the community level reaching more than 2.8 million beneficiaries all over the globe.
The program has been successful in attracting a huge interest, with many countries having already started the implementation with the existing draft materials, such as Indonesia and Bangladesh. There are 4 regional trainings planned in 2014 and several country training will be taking place naturally. Due to this success, the number of target countries has been raised from 40 to 75, and a translation into 3 additional languages has been planned.

            A Pilot Project of Mutual Management and Support for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in China
Partnership objectives 
To pilot a peer support model for people living with diabetes to manage their disease on a daily basis by integrating lifestyle modification skills, social and emotional support to achieve better control of the disease, lower the rate of complications, reduce financial burdens of family and government, and finally disseminate a model that can be scaled up and promoted across the country.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Delaying treatment or poor compliance can create serious complications such as retinopathy, kidney damage, neuron damage, foot ulcers and amputations. Without better prevention and treatment interventions, the cost of diabetes treatment will become enormous. 
Normally doctors only spend 6 hours with one diabetes patient a year. To manage disease in the rest of 8760 hours each year is a great challenge for diabetes patients. A comprehensive and integrated approach is requested to address this challenge. Increased awareness and access to treatment are not enough. People living with diabetes also need self-management support that can delay complications and improve the quality of their lives.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Trained 500 community doctors to improve their capacity and professional skills to better support diabetes patients in the community
Trained 500 peer leaders to enhance their understanding of diabetes knowledge and skills of how to motivate diabetes patients to change their behaviors, and framing interventions within a person-centered approach.  
Organize diabetes self-management camps engaging 50,000 diabetes patients and their family members to increase their ability for disease management
Promote the concept of 8760Hours Healthcare Action through publicity such as media coverage, paper publicity.
Develop the” Guideline of Healthcare Self-Management for People with Type 2 Diabetes in China” based on the field practice
Summary of impact and forward looking information 
1. Community health center knows how to support patients and peer leaders for diabetes management  2. Trained peer leaders are proactive to organize learning and sharing activities for better disease management  3. The diabetes treatment compliance rate was greatly enhanced

            Partnership objectives
Improve knowledge in the rural community of obstetric, neonatal, infant and postpartum emergencies as well as priority diseases.
Strengthen the capacity of community health workers to manage obstetric, neonatal, and infant emergencies effectively.
Establish participatory mechanisms and ensure the efficient and rapid hospitalization for obstetric, neonatal and childhood emergencies in poor households in rural areas.
Create linkages and alliances to boost the partnership between the community and public and private support facilities, and take better account of women’s needs.

            What are the health needs and challenges?
Although the government of Benin has prioritized maternal, newborn and child health, rates of maternal and neonatal mortality are still high. There are about 1,500 preventable maternal deaths per year that are due to complications during pregnancy, childbirth and the 6-week period following childbirth. A national study conducted in 2010 found an absence of basic as well as comprehensive obstetric and neonatal emergency services in the Cove-Zagnanado-Ouinhi health zone.
Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
In each of the 35 villages, a community volunteer will be appointed by the community to monitor pregnancies and women who have given birth, acting as the relay point between health centers and these women.
CARE will use mobile phone systems to build local capacity and healthcare networking. This is an innovation in Benin. Each of the 35 community volunteers will be responsible for the using mobile phones to:
Monitor pregnant women better before, during and after delivery, by recording data and transmitting them to health workers who can assess the health situation more effectively.
Inform and educate pregnant women by broadcasting specific information (e.g. via video etc.).
Contact and strengthen linkages among stakeholders in maternal and child health emergencies (e.g. phone calls to organize the transportation of women and children and their treatment in health centers).
The project plans to create a fund to support the reference/counter-reference system for beneficiaries. This fund will among other things enable communities to provide for a village motor tricycle ambulance or ambulance motorboat in an effort to overcome the remoteness of villages from health centers and district/or hospital area.
Due to the isolation of Ouinhi and its distance from health centers, this component is essential to the success of the project. The motor tricycle or motorboat ambulance will make it easier to evacuate pregnant women and children in emergencies to health centers using village routes. This will address the two major difficulties of distance and delays in administering first aid.
Lessons learned
For some long-term healthcare programs, such as “A Call for Life”, multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential. In additional to private partners, Care works with local partners, technical companies, and official government institutions, including the Department of Maternal and Child Health of the Ministry of Health, the Zou Departmental Health Agency, the Municipality of Ouinhi and regional hospital board.
 Summary of impact and forward looking information
In 2013, 5,459 people (4,364 women and 1,095 newborns) received medical care and access to healthcare.

            Partnership objective
Address future demands for HIV treatment Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) in South Africa and across Africa, by increasing the number of manufacturers and suppliers.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
Africa accounts for approximately 90% of the total usage of LPV/r in donor-funded developing countries. The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) and AbbVie signed a new licensing agreement to help ensure sustainability of long-term supply of LPV/r, the most widely used second-line HIV treatment in South Africa and across Africa. Upon obtaining a sublicense from MPP, the agreement allows generic ARV manufacturers to manufacture and sell generic versions of LPV/r throughout Africa, as well as combinations of ritonavir with other ARVs, such as atazanavir and darunavir, as alternative second-line treatments.
The MPP will work to swiftly grant licences to generic manufacturers with stringent regulatory approval.  Those that have already received regulatory approval for these medicines in South Africa will be able to distribute in the country. The South African government will consider applications from other manufacturers that wish to seek approval under its fast track process. By doing so, it will aim to secure supply of the product as treatment needs increase, as well as to support the Ministry of Health in providing care for communities living with HIV.
The agreement  also allow global manufacturers to supply LPV/r and other ritonavir-based combinations to the whole African continent. While many African countries are currently able to purchase generic versions of these medicines from India, this license will enable manufacturers in other countries where there are patents, such as China and South Africa, to manufacture LPV/r and other ritonavir-based treatments, thus broadening the supplier base for the entire African continent.
The licence is royalty free and, as is the case for all MPP licences, is non-exclusive and published on the MPP website.  The agreement represents the second licence established between MPP and AbbVie. The first agreement was for paediatric formulations of LPV/r signed in December 2014. More information are available here.

            Description of partnership activities and how they address needs and challenges
The Accelerating Access Initiative (AAI), begun in 2000, was a partnership between UNAIDS, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Bank and research-based pharmaceutical companies. Participants in AAI are committed to working with governments, international organizations and other stakeholders to find ways to broaden access, whilst ensuring rational, safe and effective use of medicines for HIV/AIDS.
The strong commitment of the AAI companies to improving access to treatment manifested itself in many innovative ways. All AAI companies had individual programs through which they provided their own antiretroviral medicines at more affordable prices in developing countries. Some AAI companies expanded manufacturing capacity to meet product demand in the developing world. Individual AAI companies also took other actions to increase the overall availability of ARVs, including the granting of voluntary licenses or non-assert declarations, contract manufacturing with generic manufacturers and technology transfer agreements. These efforts are delivered results:in September 2008, 773,803 patients in developing countries were estimated to be taking one or more medicines supplied at preferential prices by an AAI company. In addition, the number of patients in developing countries treated with generic ARVs - including those through cooperative efforts with AAI companies - increased significantly.
AAI partners recognize that expanded access to medications requires a collaborative approach with governments, NGOs, multilateral organizations, and other public and private bodies. Many AAI companies involved in initiatives to strengthen healthcare systems streamline product registrations and conduct clinical studies in developing countries. AAI companies also invested significantly in research and development of new medications - including pediatric formulations - and diagnostics, to help combat the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.
